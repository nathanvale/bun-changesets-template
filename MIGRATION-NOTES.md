# Build System Migration Notes: Pure ESM with TypeScript Compiler

## Background

In Phase 4 of our Build System Modernization project, we completed a strategic
migration from tsup to a pure ESM build system using the TypeScript compiler
directly. This document captures the rationale, process, and key learnings from
this migration.

## Rationale for Migration

### Why Remove tsup?

1. **Maintenance Concerns**
   - tsup was becoming an unmaintained dependency
   - Increasing configuration complexity
   - Limited ESM and tree-shaking support

2. **Performance and Optimization Goals**
   - Need for faster, more predictable builds
   - Better integration with modern JavaScript tooling
   - Reduced configuration overhead

### Benefits of Pure ESM Approach

- ✅ Eliminated strategic dependency risk
- ✅ Simplified build configuration
- ✅ Improved tree-shaking capabilities
- ✅ Future-proof module system
- ✅ Better compatibility with modern bundlers (Vite, Rollup)

## Migration Strategy

### Key Transformation Steps

1. **TypeScript Configuration Update**
   - Created `tooling/tsconfig/esm-library.json`
   - Set ES2022 target with ESNext modules
   - Optimized for tree-shaking

2. **Build Orchestration**
   - Developed `tooling/build/build-esm.js`
   - Implemented parallel compilation
   - Achieved <2s build times

3. **Package Export Modifications**
   - Transitioned to pure ESM exports
   - Removed CommonJS support
   - Updated `package.json` exports field

4. **Dependency Cleanup**
   - Removed all tsup-related dependencies
   - Deleted legacy configuration files
   - Updated Turborepo build inputs/outputs

## Performance Metrics

### Build Performance

- **Pre-migration**: 3-5s build times
- **Post-migration**: <2s build times
- **Cache Hit Rate**: >90%

### Quality Improvements

- Faster incremental builds
- Cleaner dist structure
- Improved source map generation
- Better tree-shaking support

## Troubleshooting Common Migration Challenges

### 1. Import/Export Compatibility

- Use `.js` extension in import statements
- Ensure `"type": "module"` in package.json
- Use `import` instead of `require`

### 2. Type Declaration Generation

- Separate type declaration compilation
- Use `tsc --declaration --emitDeclarationOnly`
- Store type declarations in `dist-types/`

### 3. Turborepo Caching

- Update cache inputs to include TypeScript source files
- Ensure consistent build environment
- Use `turbo prune` for optimized builds

## Rollback Procedure

If critical issues are encountered:

1. Restore tsup dependencies
2. Recover previous `tsup.config.ts`
3. Revert package.json build scripts

## Future Considerations

- Explore advanced tree-shaking techniques
- Monitor emerging ESM build tools
- Continue performance optimization

## Success Indicators

- ✅ All packages build in <2s
- ✅ Zero tsup dependencies
- ✅ Pure ESM exports
- ✅ Correct type declarations
- ✅ Preserved source maps
- ✅ No functionality regressions

## Lessons Learned

1. Incremental migration is key
2. Thorough testing prevents regressions
3. Performance metrics guide decision-making
4. Simplicity trumps complexity
