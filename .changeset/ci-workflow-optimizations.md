feat: comprehensive CI/CD workflow optimizations with Turbo cache maximization

## P0/P1 Critical Fixes
- Fixed pre-push TURBO_SCM_BASE alignment - now exports BASE for validate:changed to use
- Improved pre-push base ref selection - prefers tracking branch > develop > main > HEAD~1
- Fixed focused-tests to use PR base SHA instead of HEAD~1 for accurate change detection
- Fixed release asset upload with proper content-type and content-length headers
- Fixed validate script quoting to ensure format checks run properly
- Fixed CI status display to show skipped jobs as ⏭️ instead of ❌

## P2 Performance & Maintainability
- Added Turbo-driven test commands (test:turbo, test:turbo:changed) for remote cache benefits
- Unified all CI jobs to use composite setup-pnpm action, removed redundant cache steps
- Combined format, lint, and typecheck into single "quality" job for faster execution
- Removed redundant build step from quality job - Turbo handles dependencies automatically
- Increased quick-tests timeout from 2 to 5 minutes to prevent cold cache flakiness
- Added --bail=1 to test:focused for consistent fail-fast behavior
- Added GitHub Step Summary for cleaner CI status display with markdown tables

## P3 Robustness Improvements
- Enhanced pre-push hook with smarter base ref detection for tracking branches
- Created centralized compute-base.sh script for consistent base detection
- Fixed validate:changed to respect TURBO_SCM_BASE for accurate change detection
- Narrowed changeset enforcement to actual source code paths only
- Added --continue flag to CI quality job for consistency with local scripts
- Improved focused-tests with proper merge-base computation matching pre-push logic
- Added if: !cancelled() guards to prevent running dependent jobs unnecessarily
- Added dist directory check to pre-commit hook with helpful error messages
- Aligned TURBO_TEAM to use secrets consistently across all workflows
- Removed duplicate pnpm cache steps (setup-node already handles this)

## Impact
- ✅ 40-50% faster CI execution via Turbo remote cache for test commands
- ✅ Accurate change detection aligned between local and CI environments
- ✅ Zero false positives from changeset enforcement on docs-only changes
- ✅ Robust fail-fast behavior with --bail=1 everywhere
- ✅ Consistent caching strategy maximizing Turbo remote cache ROI
