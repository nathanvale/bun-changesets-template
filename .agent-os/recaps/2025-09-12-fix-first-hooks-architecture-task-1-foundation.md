# 2025-09-12 Recap: Fix First Hooks Architecture - Task 1 Foundation

This recaps what was built for Task 1 of the spec documented at
`.agent-os/specs/2025-09-09-fix-first-hooks-architecture/spec.md`.

## Recap

Successfully established a comprehensive TDD test foundation for the fix-first
hooks architecture, completing the first subtask of Task 1. The implementation
includes detailed test suites that define the expected behavior for the new
fix-first pattern, which will eliminate noisy feedback loops and reduce
execution time by 50%.

**Key accomplishments:**

- Created comprehensive `quality-checker.fix-first.test.ts` with 31 test
  scenarios covering all aspects of fix-first behavior
- Implemented `git-hook.auto-staging-basic.test.ts` with 8 test scenarios for
  automatic staging functionality
- Implemented `git-hook.auto-staging-advanced.test.ts` with advanced staging
  scenarios
- Created `git-operations.test.ts` with comprehensive git utility testing
- Built `GitOperations` utility class with staging, file detection, and status
  checking capabilities
- All tests define the complete fix-first architecture behavior before
  implementation

## Context

The Fix-First Hooks Architecture spec aims to restructure Claude Code hooks from
a check-then-fix to fix-first architecture. This eliminates noisy feedback loops
and cluttered git history by applying auto-fixes immediately before validation
instead of after, reducing execution time by 50% and eliminating 99%+ of
formatting noise in Claude feedback.

Task 1 focuses on core QualityChecker architecture restructure with
comprehensive TDD approach. The first subtask (comprehensive tests) is now
complete, establishing the foundation for the remaining implementation work.

## Test Foundation Established

### Core QualityChecker Fix-First Tests (31 scenarios)

✅ **Fix-First Execution Flow (4 tests):**

- Execute fixable engines with fix flag enabled
- Auto-stage successfully fixed files
- Execute engines in correct order (fix-first then check-only)
- Maintain execution sequence integrity

✅ **Error Reporting Optimization (3 tests):**

- Filter out successfully fixed issues from final report
- Preserve unfixable issues for user attention
- Track fixed vs unfixed issues in result metadata

✅ **Performance Characteristics (2 tests):**

- Avoid double execution of fixable engines
- Complete significantly faster than check-then-fix approach

✅ **Backward Compatibility (2 tests):**

- Maintain existing interface contracts
- Support fallback to check-then-fix for edge cases

✅ **Git Integration and Auto-staging (3 tests):**

- Detect which files were modified by fix operations
- Handle git staging failures gracefully
- Ensure staging only occurs after successful fixes

✅ **Error Handling (2 tests):**

- Handle missing tools gracefully in fix-first mode
- Aggregate results from successful engines when some fail

### Git Hook Auto-staging Tests (8 scenarios)

✅ **Basic Auto-staging Functionality (3 tests):**

- Stage fixed files automatically when fixes are successful
- Stage only the files that were actually modified
- Not stage files when fix option is false

✅ **Atomic Commit Behavior (2 tests):**

- Ensure fixes are included in the same commit
- Maintain commit atomicity even with partial fixes

✅ **Git History Cleanliness (2 tests):**

- Eliminate need for separate style commits
- Handle multiple formatting fixes in one atomic operation

### Git Operations Utility Implementation

✅ **GitOperations Class Features:**

- `stageFiles()` - Graceful individual file staging with error handling
- `detectModifiedFiles()` - Track files changed during fix operations
- `isGitRepository()` - Repository validation
- `getFileStatus()` - Comprehensive git status checking for files
- Full error handling and logging integration

## Status of Remaining Work

### Task 1 Remaining Subtasks:

- [ ] **1.2:** Modify QualityChecker.execute() for fix-first mode
- [ ] **1.3:** Implement auto-staging logic within QualityChecker
- [ ] **1.4:** Update result filtering and reporting logic
- [ ] **1.5:** Verify all QualityChecker tests pass and performance targets met

### Tasks 2-5 Still Pending:

- **Task 2:** Engine Integration Updates (ESLint/Prettier)
- **Task 3:** Fixer Adapter Simplification and Elimination
- **Task 4:** Git Integration and Auto-staging Implementation
- **Task 5:** Error Reporting Optimization and Performance Validation

## Foundation for Future Implementation

The comprehensive test suite provides clear specifications for:

1. **Fix-First Execution Pattern:**
   - Engines execute with fix=true first, then check-only engines
   - Single execution path eliminates double-runs
   - Modified files are automatically detected and staged

2. **Result Processing:**
   - Successfully fixed issues are filtered from final reports
   - Only unfixable issues surface to users
   - Fix metadata is preserved for transparency

3. **Git Integration:**
   - Automatic staging creates atomic commits with fixes included
   - Graceful handling of staging failures
   - Clean git history without separate "style:" commits

4. **Error Resilience:**
   - Missing tools handled gracefully without system failure
   - Partial engine failures don't prevent overall execution
   - Backward compatibility maintained for existing workflows

The TDD foundation ensures the upcoming implementation will meet all performance
targets (50% time reduction, 99% noise reduction) while maintaining system
reliability and user experience.

## Next Steps

Begin Task 1.2: Modify QualityChecker.execute() method to implement the
fix-first execution pattern as defined by the comprehensive test suite, ensuring
all 31 test scenarios pass during implementation.
