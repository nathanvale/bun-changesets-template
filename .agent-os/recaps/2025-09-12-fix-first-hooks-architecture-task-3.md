# 2025-09-12 Recap: Fix First Hooks Architecture - Task 3

This recaps what was built for Task 3 of the spec documented at
`.agent-os/specs/2025-09-09-fix-first-hooks-architecture/spec.md`.

## Recap

Successfully implemented comprehensive graceful degradation tests for the
quality-checker, verifying that the system properly continues operation when
quality checking tools are missing. The implementation confirms that missing
tools are reported as errors but don't cause complete system failure, allowing
the quality checker to aggregate results from available tools.

**Key accomplishments:**

- Created `quality-checker.graceful-degradation.test.ts` with 8 test scenarios
- Verified existing ToolMissingError handling works correctly
- Confirmed system continues with available tools when some are missing
- All 5 core graceful degradation tests passing
- Skipped 3 resource management tests (out of scope)

## Context

The Fix-First Hooks Architecture spec aims to restructure Claude Code hooks from
a check-then-fix to fix-first architecture. Task 3 specifically focused on
implementing graceful degradation for missing tools, ensuring the quality
checker can continue operating with reduced capabilities rather than failing
completely when tools like ESLint, Prettier, or TypeScript are unavailable.

## Test Coverage

✅ **Passing Tests:**

- Handles missing TypeScript tool gracefully
- Handles missing ESLint tool gracefully
- Handles all tools missing gracefully
- Handles mixed tool failures and successes
- Handles non-ToolMissingError exceptions differently

⏭️ **Skipped Tests (Future Work):**

- Timeout handling with remaining engines
- Backpressure implementation
- Memory pressure detection
