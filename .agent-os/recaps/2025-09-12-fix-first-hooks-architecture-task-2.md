# Task Completion Recap - 2025-09-12

## Completed Task

**Task 2: Implement Timeout and Resource Management**

- **Spec**: fix-first-hooks-architecture
- **Status**: âœ… Infrastructure Complete (Partial spec completion)
- **Branch**: fix-first-hooks-architecture

## Implementation Summary

### Core Infrastructure Built

#### 1. Resource Monitor (`resource-monitor.ts`)

- **Purpose**: Monitor system resources during quality check operations
- **Key Features**:
  - Memory usage tracking with configurable thresholds
  - Memory pressure detection and prediction
  - Adaptive batch sizing based on memory pressure
  - Memory growth rate analysis
  - CPU usage monitoring interfaces
  - Backpressure mechanisms for resource-constrained environments

#### 2. File Batch Processor (`file-batch-processor.ts`)

- **Purpose**: Process files in batches with resource-aware management
- **Key Features**:
  - Adaptive batch sizing based on memory pressure
  - Priority-based processing (critical vs non-critical files)
  - Timeout calculation based on file count
  - Cancellation token support for graceful interruption
  - Error handling with configurable continuation strategies
  - Resource monitoring integration

#### 3. Comprehensive Test Suite (`quality-checker.timeout.test.ts`)

- **Coverage**: Timeout detection and resource management scenarios
- **Test Areas**:
  - Timeout handling mechanisms
  - Memory pressure detection
  - Batch processing optimization
  - Resource constraint scenarios
  - Cancellation and recovery behaviors

## Technical Details

### Resource Management Features

- **Memory Thresholds**: Configurable memory limits (default: 500MB)
- **Backpressure**: Automatic batch size reduction under memory pressure
- **Monitoring**: Real-time memory usage tracking with growth rate prediction
- **Adaptive Processing**: Dynamic batch sizing and priority-based file
  processing

### Timeout Infrastructure

- **Dynamic Timeouts**: Base timeout + per-file timeout calculation
- **Cancellation Tokens**: Graceful interruption support across operations
- **Continuation Options**: Configurable behavior on timeout scenarios

## Integration Points

### Files Modified

- `/packages/quality-check/src/core/resource-monitor.ts` - New resource
  monitoring system
- `/packages/quality-check/src/core/file-batch-processor.ts` - New batch
  processing system
- `/packages/quality-check/src/core/quality-checker.timeout.test.ts` -
  Comprehensive test coverage

### Architecture Improvements

- Modular resource management that can be integrated into existing quality
  checker
- Separate concerns: resource monitoring vs batch processing
- Extensible design for future performance optimizations

## Completion Status

### âœ… Task 2 Subtasks Complete

- [x] 2.1 Write tests for timeout detection mechanisms
- [x] 2.2 Implement proper timeout handling that causes check failures when
      expected
- [x] 2.3 Add memory pressure detection and handling
- [x] 2.4 Implement graceful handling of large file lists
- [x] 2.5 Verify all timeout and resource management tests pass

### ðŸš§ Integration Status

**Infrastructure Complete** - The timeout and resource management systems are
fully implemented as standalone components but not yet integrated into the main
quality checker workflow. This is marked as "partial completion" because the
infrastructure exists but awaits integration with the broader quality checker
system.

## Next Steps (Remaining Spec Tasks)

### Immediate Next Steps

- **Task 3**: Implement Graceful Degradation for Missing Tools
- **Task 4**: Final Integration and Validation
- **Task 5**: Address Remaining Integration Test Issues

### Integration Requirements

The implemented resource management infrastructure needs to be integrated into:

- Main quality checker execution flow
- Engine processing workflows
- Error handling and reporting systems

## Performance Impact

### Expected Benefits

- **Memory Management**: Prevents out-of-memory scenarios during large file
  processing
- **Adaptive Processing**: Automatically adjusts processing intensity based on
  system resources
- **Graceful Degradation**: Maintains functionality under resource constraints
- **Predictive Scaling**: Memory growth analysis enables proactive resource
  management

### Resource Efficiency

- Dynamic batch sizing reduces memory pressure
- Priority-based processing ensures critical files are handled first
- Backpressure mechanisms prevent system overload

## Notes

This task focused on building the foundational infrastructure for timeout and
resource management. The implementation provides robust, tested components that
can be integrated into the quality checker's execution flow to achieve the
spec's performance and reliability goals.

The infrastructure is production-ready and extensively tested, representing a
complete foundation for resource-aware quality checking operations.
