# Task Completion Recap - 2025-09-08

## Project: Quality Checker V2 Migration

### Spec Context

Migrate the quality-check package from V1 to V2 implementation, consolidating
the codebase and improving test coverage from 46.61% to >60%. This migration
unifies all facades to use the performant V2 architecture (<300ms warm runs)
while maintaining backward compatibility, removing deprecated code, and ensuring
consistent behavior across CLI, API, and Git hook entry points.

### Completed Tasks (Phase 1: Facade Testing and Preparation)

#### Task 1: Comprehensive V2 Facade Compatibility Tests ✓

- Created test suite for api.ts facade with V2 implementation
- Created test suite for git-hook.ts facade with V2 implementation
- Created test suite for test-utils/api-wrappers.ts with V2
- Wrote backward compatibility verification tests
- Added integration tests for facade interactions
- Verified all new tests pass

**Implementation Details:**

- **Files Created:**
  - `/packages/quality-check/src/facades/api.test.ts`
  - `/packages/quality-check/src/facades/git-hook.test.ts`
  - `/packages/quality-check/src/facades/v2-backward-compatibility.test.ts`
  - `/packages/quality-check/src/facades/v2-facade-integration.test.ts`
  - `/packages/quality-check/src/test-utils/api-wrappers.test.ts`

#### Task 2: Update api.ts Facade to Use QualityCheckerV2 ✓

- Replaced QualityChecker import with QualityCheckerV2
- Updated instantiation and configuration logic
- Verified all API methods work correctly with V2
- Confirmed api.test.ts functionality
- Fixed compatibility issues found
- Verified api.ts tests pass with V2

#### Task 3: Update git-hook.ts Facade to Use QualityCheckerV2 ✓

- Replaced QualityChecker import with QualityCheckerV2
- Updated pre-commit hook integration code
- Tested staged file processing with V2
- Verified error reporting and exit codes work correctly
- Tested git hook in actual git workflow
- Verified git-hook.ts tests pass

#### Task 4: Update test-utils/api-wrappers.ts to Use V2 ✓

- Updated imports and initialization to V2
- Verified test utility functions work with V2
- Ensured mock and stub helpers are compatible
- Updated type definitions for V2
- Ran tests using api-wrappers
- Verified all wrapper tests pass

### Implementation Status

**Phase 1 Completion:** 4/4 tasks completed (100%)

**Overall Progress:** 4/22 total tasks completed (18.2%)

### Notes

- This was a **partial implementation** as requested by the user, focusing
  specifically on Phase 1: Facade Testing and Preparation
- All facade components (api.ts, git-hook.ts, test-utils/api-wrappers.ts) have
  been successfully migrated to use QualityCheckerV2
- Comprehensive test suites have been created to verify backward compatibility
  and integration functionality
- The migration maintains the existing public API while leveraging the improved
  V2 performance architecture

### Next Steps

**Phase 2: Test Coverage Migration (Tasks 5-10)**

- Clean up deprecated V2 facades
- Create V2 error handling test suite
- Migrate TypeScript and ESLint error enhancement tests
- Improve test coverage to >60%

**Phase 3: Implementation Consolidation (Tasks 11-15)**

- Prepare for QualityChecker class rename
- Remove V1 implementation files
- Clean up unused V1 dependencies
- Rename V2 files to primary implementation

**Phase 4: Reference and Import Updates (Tasks 16-21)**

- Update main export files
- Update facade imports
- Update CLI imports and functionality
- Global reference cleanup

**Phase 5: Performance and Integration Validation (Task 22)**

- Validate performance and integration
- Verify <300ms warm run performance
- Complete end-to-end testing
