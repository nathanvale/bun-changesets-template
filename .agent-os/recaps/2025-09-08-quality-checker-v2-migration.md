# Task Completion Recap - 2025-09-08

## Project: Quality Checker V2 Migration

### Spec Context

Migrate the quality-check package from V1 to V2 implementation, consolidating
the codebase and improving test coverage from 46.61% to >60%. This migration
unifies all facades to use the performant V2 architecture (<300ms warm runs)
while maintaining backward compatibility, removing deprecated code, and ensuring
consistent behavior across CLI, API, and Git hook entry points.

**Phase 3 Achievement:** Successfully completed implementation consolidation by
completely removing the V1 implementation and establishing the V2 architecture
as the primary codebase. The QualityChecker class now uses modern TypeScript,
ESLint, and Prettier engines with incremental compilation, structured logging,
and timeout management - delivering the performance and reliability improvements
promised by the V2 architecture.
