# Task Execution Rules

## Overview

Execute tasks for a given spec following three MANDATORY sequential phases.

### ‚õî PROCESS ENFORCEMENT RULES ‚õî
```
RULE 1: You CANNOT proceed to Phase 2 until ALL Phase 1 steps are COMPLETE
RULE 2: You CANNOT proceed to Phase 3 until ALL Phase 2 tasks are COMPLETE  
RULE 3: You CANNOT end this command until Phase 3 is COMPLETE
RULE 4: You MUST use TodoWrite to track ALL task progress
RULE 5: Skipping ANY step requires EXPLICIT user override

VIOLATION CONSEQUENCE: Task execution will FAIL and require full restart
```

### Phase Structure:
1. **Pre-execution setup** (Steps 1-3) - Setup and validation
2. **Task execution loop** (Step 4) - Implementation work  
3. **Post-execution tasks** (Step 5) - Finalization

### üî¥ VALIDATION CHECKPOINT üî¥
Before reading further, confirm you understand:
- [ ] I will complete ALL steps in sequence
- [ ] I will NOT skip ahead to implementation
- [ ] I will use TodoWrite for progress tracking
- [ ] I understand violations cause failure

<pre_flight_check>
EXECUTE: @.agent-os/instructions/meta/pre-flight.md
</pre_flight_check>

<process_flow>

## Phase 1: Pre-Execution Setup

<step number="1" name="task_assignment" validation="required">

### Step 1: Task Assignment

Identify which tasks to execute from the spec.

#### üõë STEP 1 GATE CHECK üõë
```
BEFORE PROCEEDING:
1. You MUST use TodoWrite to create task tracking list
2. You MUST get explicit user confirmation
3. You MUST NOT start any implementation work

IF YOU SKIP THIS: Execution will fail
```

<task_selection>
  <explicit>
    IF user provides specific_tasks array:
      USE: Exact task numbers provided
  </explicit>
  <implicit>
    IF no specific tasks provided:
      1. READ: spec's tasks.md file
      2. FIND: First parent task where status != "‚úì Completed"
      3. SELECT: That task and all its subtasks
  </implicit>
</task_selection>

<instructions>
  1. USE TodoWrite: Create todo list with ALL identified tasks
  2. DETERMINE: Task selection method (explicit vs implicit)
  3. IDENTIFY: Target task(s) to execute
  4. OUTPUT: "I will execute: [numbered list of tasks]"
  5. ASK: "Do you want me to proceed with these tasks?"
  6. WAIT: For user confirmation (yes/no)
  7. VALIDATE: User said "yes" before continuing
</instructions>

<validation_checklist>
‚òê TodoWrite used to create task list
‚òê Tasks clearly identified and listed
‚òê User confirmation explicitly received
‚òê No implementation work started
</validation_checklist>

</step>

<step number="2" name="context_analysis">

### Step 2: Context Analysis

Gather minimal necessary context for task understanding.

#### üõë STEP 2 GATE CHECK üõë
```
IMPLEMENTATION NOTE: If subagent doesn't exist:
- READ files directly using Read tool
- DO NOT skip this step
- DO NOT proceed without context
```

<instructions>
  1. LOAD CONTEXT (use Read tool if no subagent):
     
     REQUEST 1: "Load the spec tasks.md file from [SPEC_PATH]/tasks.md"
     
     REQUEST 2 (if not in context): "Get product pitch from @.agent-os/product/mission-lite.md"
     
     REQUEST 3 (if not in context): "Get spec summary from [SPEC_PATH]/spec-lite.md"
     
     REQUEST 4 (if not in context): "Get technical approach from [SPEC_PATH]/sub-specs/technical-spec.md"
  
  2. WAIT: For subagent to return all requested information
  3. VERIFY: Essential context loaded successfully
</instructions>

<context_requirements>
  <mandatory>
    - tasks.md (MUST exist and be loaded)
  </mandatory>
  <optional>
    - mission-lite.md (load if exists)
    - spec-lite.md (load if exists)
    - technical-spec.md (load if exists)
  </optional>
</context_requirements>

</step>

<step number="3" name="git_branch_management">

### Step 3: Git Branch Management

Ensure proper git branch isolation for the spec.

#### üõë STEP 3 GATE CHECK üõë
```
IMPLEMENTATION NOTE: If subagent doesn't exist:
- USE Bash tool for git commands directly
- DO NOT skip this step
- MUST be on correct branch before Phase 2
```

<instructions>
  1. EXTRACT: Spec folder name from spec_srd_reference path
  2. DERIVE: Branch name by removing date prefix from folder name
     Example: "2025-03-15-password-reset" ‚Üí "password-reset"
  
  3. EXECUTE GIT WORKFLOW (use Bash if no subagent):
     "Manage git branch for spec implementation:
      - Target branch name: [DERIVED_BRANCH_NAME]
      - If branch exists: switch to it
      - If branch doesn't exist: create from main/master and switch
      - If uncommitted changes exist: stash them first
      - Confirm: branch is ready for work"
  
  4. WAIT: For confirmation that correct branch is active
  5. VERIFY: On correct branch before proceeding
</instructions>

</step>

## Phase 2: Task Execution Loop

<step number="4" name="task_execution_loop">

### Step 4: Task Execution Loop

#### üîí PHASE 2 ENTRY VALIDATION üîí
```
STOP AND VERIFY:
‚òë Phase 1 Step 1: Task assignment complete? 
‚òë Phase 1 Step 2: Context loaded?
‚òë Phase 1 Step 3: Git branch ready?
‚òë TodoWrite: Task list created and active?

IF ANY UNCHECKED: GO BACK TO INCOMPLETE STEP
```

**CRITICAL**: This is an iterative loop. You MUST execute ALL assigned tasks completely before moving to Phase 3.

<execution_algorithm>
  1. LOAD (once): @.agent-os/instructions/core/execute-task.md
  
  2. SET: assigned_tasks = tasks from Step 1
  3. SET: current_index = 0
  
  4. WHILE current_index < length(assigned_tasks):
     a. GET: current_task = assigned_tasks[current_index]
     b. EXECUTE: Instructions from execute-task.md with:
        - parent_task_number = current_task.number
        - subtasks = current_task.subtasks
     c. WAIT: Until current_task is fully complete
     d. UPDATE: tasks.md to mark current_task as "‚úì Completed"
     e. INCREMENT: current_index += 1
     f. CHECK: If user requests stop, BREAK loop
  
  5. VERIFY: All assigned tasks show "‚úì Completed" in tasks.md
  
  6. **MANDATORY**: PROCEED to Step 5 (Phase 3)
</execution_algorithm>

<loop_termination>
  <normal_exit>
    CONDITION: current_index >= length(assigned_tasks)
    ACTION: Proceed immediately to Step 5
  </normal_exit>
  <early_exit>
    CONDITION: User explicitly requests "stop" or "pause"
    ACTION: Save progress and ask if user wants to continue later
  </early_exit>
  <error_exit>
    CONDITION: Blocking error that cannot be resolved
    ACTION: Report error, save progress, await user guidance
  </error_exit>
</loop_termination>

<verification>
  AFTER loop completes:
  1. READ: tasks.md
  2. VERIFY: All assigned tasks marked "‚úì Completed"
  3. IF not all complete: REPORT which tasks remain
  4. REGARDLESS: PROCEED to Step 5
</verification>

</step>

## Phase 3: Post-Execution Tasks

<step number="5" name="post_execution_tasks">

### Step 5: Run Task Completion Steps

**MANDATORY**: This phase MUST be executed. Never end without completing these steps.

<instructions>
  1. LOAD: @.agent-os/instructions/core/post-execution-tasks.md
  
  2. EXECUTE: Every step in post-execution-tasks.md process_flow sequentially:
     - Step 1: Run full test suite
     - Step 2: Execute git workflow (commit, push, PR)
     - Step 3: Verify all tasks marked complete
     - Step 4: Update roadmap if applicable
     - Step 5: Create recap document
     - Step 6: Generate completion summary
     - Step 7: Play notification sound
  
  3. WAIT: For each step to complete before proceeding to next
  
  4. VERIFY: All post-execution steps completed successfully
  
  5. REPORT: "Task execution complete. All phases finished successfully."
