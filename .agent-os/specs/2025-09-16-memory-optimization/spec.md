> Spec: Memory Optimization for Test Suite
> Created: 2025-09-16

## Overview

Implement comprehensive memory optimization for the test suite to prevent heap exhaustion errors and improve test performance. This feature will reduce test failures due to memory issues and enable stable CI/CD pipeline execution by implementing proper resource management and monitoring.

## User Stories

### Developer Running Tests

As a developer, I want to run the complete test suite without memory exhaustion errors, so that I can validate my changes reliably.

The developer runs `pnpm test` and the tests execute successfully without JavaScript heap out of memory errors. The system automatically manages memory through increased heap allocation, proper resource cleanup, and memory monitoring, providing visibility into memory usage patterns during test execution.

### CI/CD Pipeline Execution

As a DevOps engineer, I want the CI/CD pipeline to execute tests reliably without memory-related failures, so that deployments can proceed without manual intervention.

The pipeline triggers test execution which completes successfully with proper memory management. The system tracks memory usage, enforces limits, and provides detailed reporting when memory issues are detected, ensuring predictable pipeline execution times.

## Spec Scope

1. **Heap Size Configuration** - Implement Node.js heap size increase to 4GB across all test commands and scripts
2. **Resource Cleanup** - Add proper disposal patterns for TypeScript, ESLint, and file operations
3. **Memory Monitoring** - Implement memory usage tracking and reporting in test execution
4. **Test Infrastructure** - Create setup/teardown hooks for resource management
5. **Performance Profiling** - Enable memory profiling capabilities for debugging

## Out of Scope

- Complete rewrite of quality-check architecture
- Migration to different test framework
- Implementation of custom memory allocator
- Real-time memory visualization dashboard
- Automatic memory leak detection and fixing

## Expected Deliverable

1. Tests run successfully without heap exhaustion errors when executing `pnpm test`
2. Memory usage reports display in test output showing before/after metrics
3. Resource cleanup verified through stable memory patterns across multiple test runs
