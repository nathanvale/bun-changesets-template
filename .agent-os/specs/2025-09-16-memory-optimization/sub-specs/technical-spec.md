# Technical Specification

This is the technical specification for the spec detailed in @.agent-os/specs/2025-09-16-memory-optimization/spec.md

## Technical Requirements

### Phase 1: Immediate Heap Size Increase
- Update all test scripts in package.json to use NODE_OPTIONS='--max-old-space-size=4096'
- Modify test-and-log.sh scripts to export NODE_OPTIONS environment variable
- Ensure vitest commands use proper Node.js invocation method for ESM compatibility

### Phase 2: Memory Profiling and Investigation
- Enable Node.js inspector with --inspect flag for memory profiling
- Implement Chrome DevTools integration for heap snapshot analysis
- Add specific profiling commands for quality-check operations
- Create memory usage baseline measurements

### Phase 3: Resource Management Implementation

#### TypeScript Engine Optimization
- Implement dispose() method in TypeScriptEngine class
- Clear compilerHost and program references after use
- Add manual garbage collection triggers where appropriate
- Implement incremental compilation cache management

#### ESLint Engine Cleanup
- Add try/finally blocks for proper resource cleanup
- Clear ESLint cache after each operation
- Dispose of AST objects immediately after processing
- Implement batched file processing to limit concurrent operations

#### File Operations Optimization
- Implement streaming for large file processing
- Use chunked reading instead of loading entire files into memory
- Add buffer pooling for repeated file operations
- Implement proper file handle cleanup

### Phase 4: Test Infrastructure Enhancement

#### Memory Monitoring Setup
- Create tests/setup/memory-cleanup.ts configuration file
- Implement beforeEach/afterEach hooks for memory tracking
- Add memory usage reporting to test output
- Configure teardownTimeout for proper cleanup

#### Resource Limits
- Set per-test memory limit of 500MB
- Implement early warning system at 80% threshold
- Add automatic test failure on memory limit breach
- Create memory usage trends reporting

## Performance Criteria

- Test suite completes without heap exhaustion errors
- Memory usage stays below 4GB during full test run
- Individual test memory usage remains under 500MB
- Memory is properly released between test suites
- No accumulative memory growth across test iterations
