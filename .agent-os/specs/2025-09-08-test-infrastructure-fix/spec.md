# Spec Requirements Document

> Spec: Test Infrastructure Fix Created: 2025-09-08

## Overview

Fix the failing integration tests in the quality-check package by addressing
mock isolation issues, disabling real Claude hook execution during tests, and
fixing configuration loading problems. This will restore test suite stability
and enable reliable CI/CD pipelines with a target of 0% failure rate for
previously passing tests.

## User Stories

### Developer Running Tests

As a developer, I want to run the test suite without real Claude hooks
executing, so that tests complete quickly and don't block on quality issues.

When running `pnpm test`, the test suite should execute in a controlled
environment where all external dependencies are mocked, including the Claude
hook execution. Tests should run in isolation without side effects, complete
within reasonable time limits (<100ms per test ideally), and provide clear
pass/fail status without interference from actual quality checks.

### CI/CD Pipeline Execution

As a CI/CD pipeline, I want to execute integration tests reliably, so that build
status accurately reflects code quality.

The pipeline needs deterministic test execution where the same code produces the
same test results, proper exit codes that reflect actual test status, and clear
error messages when tests fail. Configuration files should be loaded from test
fixtures rather than the filesystem, and tests should not create temporary
directories or spawn child processes.

### Quality Check Development

As a quality-check package maintainer, I want integration tests that validate
actual behavior, so that I can confidently refactor and improve the codebase.

Tests should validate the quality checker's behavior through proper mocking and
assertions, test various configuration scenarios (ESLint, Prettier, TypeScript),
verify autopilot decisions and fix behavior, and ensure multi-engine aggregation
works correctly. All tests should use direct API calls rather than process
spawning.

## Spec Scope

1. **Hook Isolation** - Disable real Claude hook execution in test environments
   through environment variables or test-specific mocks
2. **Mock Infrastructure** - Create proper test doubles for quality checker,
   file system operations, and process management
3. **Configuration Loading** - Fix ESLint flat config detection and ensure test
   fixtures are loaded correctly
4. **Test Assertions** - Update test expectations to match actual output and
   handle error messages appropriately
5. **Performance Baseline** - Establish performance metrics and ensure tests run
   within acceptable time limits

## Out of Scope

- Complete rewrite of test infrastructure from scratch
- Migration to a different testing framework
- Performance optimization beyond basic mock implementation
- Adding new test coverage for untested features
- Refactoring production code (only test code changes)

## Expected Deliverable

1. All 23 currently failing tests pass consistently without flaky behavior
2. Test execution time reduced to <100ms average per test (from current 761ms)
3. CI/CD pipeline runs successfully with proper exit codes and no false failures
