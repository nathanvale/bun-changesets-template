# Spec Summary (Lite)

Fix failing integration tests by disabling real Claude hook execution during tests, implementing proper mock isolation, and fixing configuration loading issues. Restore test suite stability with 0% failure rate for previously passing tests and reduce average test execution time from 761ms to <100ms through direct API usage instead of process spawning.
