# Execution Recap

## Session 1: 2025-09-08 06:05

### Branch

`task-execution-20250908-0557`

### Tasks Completed

- ✅ 1.1 Write tests for environment variable control (CLAUDE_HOOK_DISABLED)
- ✅ 1.2 Add CLAUDE_HOOK_DISABLED check to Claude hook entry points
- ✅ 1.3 Create test-utils/test-environment.ts with setup/teardown helpers
- ✅ 1.4 Fix process.exit mock to capture exit codes without throwing
- ✅ 1.5 Implement proper stdin/stdout/stderr isolation between tests
- ✅ 1.6 Verify all hook isolation tests pass

### Changes Made

1. **Added CLAUDE_HOOK_DISABLED environment variable tests** - Created
   comprehensive tests to verify that the hook can be disabled via environment
   variable
2. **Implemented hook disabling mechanism** - Added checks in both the binary
   entry point and facade to immediately exit when CLAUDE_HOOK_DISABLED is set
3. **Created test environment utilities** - Implemented a complete test
   isolation framework including:
   - MockReadable and MockWritable streams for stdin/stdout/stderr isolation
   - Process.exit mock that captures exit codes without throwing
   - InMemoryFileSystem for test file operations
   - MockQualityChecker for predictable test results
   - MockConfigLoader for test fixtures
   - Standard setup/teardown helpers

### Test Status

- Claude hook unit tests: ✅ All 10 tests passing
- Overall test suite: ❌ 23 tests still failing (298 passing)
- Remaining work needed on tasks 2-5 to fix all integration tests

### Next Steps

Continue with Task 2: Create Mock Infrastructure to address the remaining
failing tests.

## Session 2: 2025-09-08 06:10

### Branch

`task-execution-20250908-0557` (continued)

### Tasks Completed

- ✅ 2.1 Write tests for MockQualityChecker class
- ✅ 2.2 Implement MockQualityChecker with predictable results
- ✅ 2.3 Create InMemoryFileSystem using Map<string, string>
- ✅ 2.4 Implement MockConfigLoader for test fixtures
- ✅ 2.5 Create mock factory pattern in test-utils/mock-factory.ts
- ⏸️ 2.6 Replace real quality checker with mocks in all integration tests
  (skipped - requires extensive refactoring)
- ✅ 2.7 Verify mock infrastructure tests pass

### Changes Made

1. **Created comprehensive test suite** - Added test-environment.test.ts with 28
   tests covering all mock components
2. **Fixed test environment teardown** - Corrected environment variable
   restoration in setupTestEnvironment
3. **Created mock factory pattern** - Implemented mock-factory.ts with:
   - MockQualityCheckerFactory for different test scenarios
   - MockFileSystemFactory for test file structures
   - MockConfigLoaderFactory for configuration presets
   - MockEnvironmentFactory for complete test environments
   - Helper functions for assertions and payload creation

### Test Status

- Mock infrastructure tests: ✅ All 28 tests passing
- Overall test suite: ❌ 23 tests still failing (requires Task 2.6 completion)

### Next Steps

- Complete Task 2.6: Replace real quality checker with mocks in all integration
  tests
- Continue with Task 3: Fix Configuration Loading
- Then Task 4: Update Test Assertions and Performance
