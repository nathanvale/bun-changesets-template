# Execution Recap

## Session: 2025-09-08 06:05

### Branch
`task-execution-20250908-0557`

### Tasks Completed
- ✅ 1.1 Write tests for environment variable control (CLAUDE_HOOK_DISABLED)
- ✅ 1.2 Add CLAUDE_HOOK_DISABLED check to Claude hook entry points  
- ✅ 1.3 Create test-utils/test-environment.ts with setup/teardown helpers
- ✅ 1.4 Fix process.exit mock to capture exit codes without throwing
- ✅ 1.5 Implement proper stdin/stdout/stderr isolation between tests
- ✅ 1.6 Verify all hook isolation tests pass

### Changes Made
1. **Added CLAUDE_HOOK_DISABLED environment variable tests** - Created comprehensive tests to verify that the hook can be disabled via environment variable
2. **Implemented hook disabling mechanism** - Added checks in both the binary entry point and facade to immediately exit when CLAUDE_HOOK_DISABLED is set
3. **Created test environment utilities** - Implemented a complete test isolation framework including:
   - MockReadable and MockWritable streams for stdin/stdout/stderr isolation
   - Process.exit mock that captures exit codes without throwing
   - InMemoryFileSystem for test file operations
   - MockQualityChecker for predictable test results
   - MockConfigLoader for test fixtures
   - Standard setup/teardown helpers

### Test Status
- Claude hook unit tests: ✅ All 10 tests passing
- Overall test suite: ❌ 23 tests still failing (298 passing)
- Remaining work needed on tasks 2-5 to fix all integration tests

### Next Steps
Continue with Task 2: Create Mock Infrastructure to address the remaining failing tests.
