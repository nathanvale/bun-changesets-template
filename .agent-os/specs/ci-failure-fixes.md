# CI Failure Fixes Specification

## Overview

Fix critical CI pipeline failures while preserving the successful modular CI
architecture. Root cause analysis shows voice-vault dependency issues are
blocking Type Check, Build, and Test jobs across all platforms.

## Problem Analysis

### Current Failures

1. **Type Check**: Missing voice-vault dependencies (@orchestr8/logger, openai,
   @elevenlabs/elevenlabs-js)
2. **Build**: Fails due to type check failures
3. **Tests**: Failing on ubuntu, macos, windows due to missing dependencies
4. **Commit Lint**: Configuration issue with commitlint.config.js

### Current Success

- Modular CI architecture (Setup, Lint, Format jobs) working correctly
- CI ADHD optimization implementation complete and functional

## Solution Strategy

### Phase 1: Voice-vault Dependency Resolution

**Approach**: Make voice-vault conditional/optional in CI to avoid external
dependency requirements

1. **Identify voice-vault usage patterns**
   - Search codebase for voice-vault imports/usage
   - Document which files depend on voice-vault
   - Determine if voice-vault is dev-only or runtime dependency

2. **Implement conditional loading**
   - Wrap voice-vault imports in try-catch blocks
   - Add environment variable to disable voice-vault in CI
   - Ensure graceful degradation when voice-vault unavailable

3. **Update CI configuration**
   - Set environment variables to disable voice-vault features
   - Verify type checking passes without voice-vault
   - Ensure builds complete successfully

### Phase 2: Cross-platform Test Fixes

**Approach**: Fix test failures on all platforms simultaneously

1. **Analyze test failure patterns**
   - Identify if failures are voice-vault related or platform-specific
   - Document specific test cases failing
   - Determine if tests need voice-vault or can be mocked/skipped

2. **Implement test fixes**
   - Skip voice-vault dependent tests in CI environment
   - Add proper mocking for voice-vault functionality if needed
   - Ensure test suite runs clean on all platforms

### Phase 3: Commit Lint Configuration

**Approach**: Quick configuration fix

1. **Fix commitlint.config.js**
   - Verify configuration syntax
   - Ensure proper export format
   - Test configuration locally

## Implementation Requirements

### Voice-vault Conditional Loading

```typescript
// Pattern for conditional imports
let voiceVault: any = null
try {
  if (process.env.VOICE_VAULT_ENABLED !== 'false') {
    voiceVault = await import('voice-vault')
  }
} catch (error) {
  console.warn('Voice-vault not available in CI environment')
}
```

### CI Environment Variables

```yaml
env:
  VOICE_VAULT_ENABLED: false
  CI: true
```

### Test Conditional Logic

```typescript
// Pattern for conditional tests
const shouldRunVoiceVaultTests = process.env.VOICE_VAULT_ENABLED !== 'false'

describe.skipIf(!shouldRunVoiceVaultTests)('Voice Vault Tests', () => {
  // voice-vault dependent tests
})
```

## Success Criteria

### Phase 1 Success

- [ ] Type Check job passes in CI
- [ ] Build job completes successfully
- [ ] No voice-vault dependency errors in CI logs
- [ ] Local development with voice-vault still works

### Phase 2 Success

- [ ] Test job passes on ubuntu platform
- [ ] Test job passes on macos platform
- [ ] Test job passes on windows platform
- [ ] All test failures resolved

### Phase 3 Success

- [ ] Commit Lint job passes
- [ ] commitlint.config.js syntax valid
- [ ] Commit message validation working

### Overall Success

- [ ] All CI jobs green across all platforms
- [ ] Modular CI architecture preserved
- [ ] No regression in working CI components
- [ ] Local development experience unchanged

## Rollback Strategy

### Safeguards

1. **Preserve working CI components**
   - Do not modify successful Setup, Lint, Format jobs
   - Keep modular architecture intact
   - Test changes in isolation

2. **Incremental deployment**
   - Test each phase independently
   - Verify no regression before proceeding
   - Maintain ability to revert individual changes

3. **Rollback triggers**
   - If any working CI component breaks
   - If local development experience degrades
   - If changes require external dependency additions

### Rollback procedure

1. Revert specific commits affecting broken components
2. Restore previous CI configuration
3. Verify all previously working jobs return to green status

## Implementation Order

1. **Investigate and document** current voice-vault usage patterns
2. **Implement conditional loading** for voice-vault dependencies
3. **Update CI environment** to disable voice-vault
4. **Fix test failures** across all platforms
5. **Resolve commit lint** configuration issue
6. **Verify complete CI pipeline** functionality

## Constraints

- **No breaking changes** to local development workflow
- **No modifications** to working CI jobs (Setup, Lint, Format)
- **No external dependency additions**
- **Maintain** modular CI architecture
- **Preserve** CI ADHD optimization features

## Testing Strategy

### Pre-deployment Testing

1. Test conditional loading locally with VOICE_VAULT_ENABLED=false
2. Verify all test suites pass with voice-vault disabled
3. Confirm type checking works without voice-vault
4. Validate build process completes successfully

### CI Testing

1. Deploy changes to CI environment
2. Monitor all job outputs for errors
3. Verify cross-platform compatibility
4. Confirm no regression in working components

This specification focuses on pragmatic solutions that address the root cause
while preserving all working CI infrastructure.
