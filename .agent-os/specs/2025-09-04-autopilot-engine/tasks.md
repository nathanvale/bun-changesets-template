# Spec Tasks

These are the tasks to be completed for the spec detailed in @.agent-os/specs/2025-09-04-autopilot-engine/spec.md

> Created: 2025-09-04
> Status: Ready for Implementation

## Tasks

- [ ] 1. Create Autopilot Core Implementation
  - [ ] 1.1 Write tests for Autopilot class structure and basic methods
  - [ ] 1.2 Create src/adapters/autopilot.ts with Autopilot class shell
  - [ ] 1.3 Define ALWAYS_SAFE rule set with 54 formatting and modernization rules
  - [ ] 1.4 Define CONTEXT_DEPENDENT rule set with 5 context-aware rules
  - [ ] 1.5 Define NEVER_AUTO rule set with 11+ security and complexity rules
  - [ ] 1.6 Implement classify() method for issue categorization
  - [ ] 1.7 Verify all core methods pass unit tests

- [ ] 2. Implement Decision Logic Engine
  - [ ] 2.1 Write tests for decision scenarios (FIX_SILENTLY, FIX_AND_REPORT, REPORT_ONLY, CONTINUE)
  - [ ] 2.2 Implement main decide() method with classification logic
  - [ ] 2.3 Add confidence scoring for each decision type
  - [ ] 2.4 Handle edge cases (empty issues, all fixable, all unfixable, mixed)
  - [ ] 2.5 Verify decision logic passes all test scenarios

- [ ] 3. Add Context Analysis System  
  - [ ] 3.1 Write tests for file type detection (test, dev, production, UI files)
  - [ ] 3.2 Implement checkContext() method for context-dependent rules
  - [ ] 3.3 Add file path analysis logic (test patterns, dev patterns, UI extensions)
  - [ ] 3.4 Implement context-specific safety checks for each CONTEXT_DEPENDENT rule
  - [ ] 3.5 Verify context analysis works correctly for all file types

- [ ] 4. Create TypeScript Type Definitions
  - [ ] 4.1 Write tests validating AutopilotDecision interface usage  
  - [ ] 4.2 Add AutopilotDecision interface to src/types.ts
  - [ ] 4.3 Add Classification interface to src/types.ts
  - [ ] 4.4 Ensure full TypeScript coverage with no any types
  - [ ] 4.5 Verify type definitions compile and integrate properly

- [ ] 5. Performance Optimization & Validation
  - [ ] 5.1 Write performance tests for <10ms classification requirement
  - [ ] 5.2 Benchmark rule lookup performance with Set.has() operations
  - [ ] 5.3 Optimize classification algorithm for speed if needed
  - [ ] 5.4 Verify memory usage remains minimal and consistent
  - [ ] 5.5 Confirm all performance tests pass requirements
