# Spec Requirements Document

> Spec: Autopilot Engine - Smart Classification & Auto-Fix System Created:
> 2025-09-04 Status: Planning

## Overview

Implement an intelligent Autopilot adapter that classifies code quality issues
into safe/unsafe categories and automatically fixes 80%+ of common issues
without human intervention. This engine will serve as the core decision-making
component for Claude's quality enforcement system, ensuring zero false positives
while maximizing automation rate.

## User Stories

### AI Assistant Automation

As Claude (AI coding assistant), I want to automatically fix safe formatting and
style issues silently, so that developers never see interruptions for trivial
problems like missing semicolons or inconsistent spacing.

**Workflow:** Claude generates code → Autopilot classifies issues → Safe issues
get fixed silently → Only complex issues reach the developer → Developer sees
clean, formatted code with only meaningful feedback.

### Developer Productivity

As a developer using Claude Code, I want the system to distinguish between
trivial fixes (semicolons, formatting) and important issues (type errors,
security), so that I only get interrupted for problems that require my judgment.

**Workflow:** Developer saves file → Autopilot analyzes issues → Formats code
automatically → Reports only critical issues → Developer focuses on logic, not
style.

### Team Code Quality

As a team lead, I want consistent code style across all AI-generated and
human-written code, so that code reviews focus on logic and architecture rather
than formatting debates.

**Workflow:** Team uses Claude → Autopilot enforces consistent style → All code
follows same patterns → Code reviews become more efficient → Team maintains
quality standards.

## Spec Scope

1. **Rule Classification System** - Categorize ESLint rules into Always Safe (54
   rules), Context-Dependent (5 rules), and Never Auto (11+ rules)
2. **Decision Engine** - Smart logic that decides whether to fix silently, fix
   and report, or report only based on issue analysis
3. **Context Analysis** - File type detection (test files, dev files,
   production) to make smarter decisions about context-dependent rules
4. **Fix Verification** - Safety checks to ensure auto-fixes never break working
   code
5. **Performance Optimization** - Sub-10ms classification speed to avoid
   blocking developer workflow

## Out of Scope

- Machine learning or AI-based classification (use rule-based logic)
- Cross-file analysis or project-wide pattern detection
- Custom rule definition or user-configurable rule sets
- Real-time learning from user corrections
- Integration with external services or APIs

## Expected Deliverable

1. **80%+ automation rate** - Verified by testing against common ESLint/Prettier
   issues with silent fixing of safe rules
2. **Zero false positives** - No auto-fixes that break working code, verified
   through comprehensive test suite
3. **Sub-10ms performance** - Classification and decision-making completes
   quickly enough for real-time use
