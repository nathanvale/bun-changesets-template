> Spec: Vitest Migration with Wallaby Integration Created: 2025-08-26 Status:
> Planning

## Overview

Migrate the testing infrastructure from Bun's native test runner to Vitest while
maintaining Bun as the runtime environment, enabling full Wallaby.js integration
with advanced mocking capabilities and maintaining sub-50ms feedback loops for
ADHD-optimized development.

## User Stories

### Developer Testing Experience

As a developer with ADHD, I want to use Vitest for all testing so that I have
consistent mocking APIs, real-time Wallaby feedback, and a single mental model
across all testing scenarios.

When working on tests, I need immediate visual feedback in my editor showing
which tests are passing/failing, inline coverage indicators, and the ability to
use advanced mocking features like fake timers, MSW for API mocking, and React
Testing Library for component testing. The migration should preserve the fast
feedback loops that are critical for maintaining focus and productivity.

### CI/CD Pipeline Consistency

As a DevOps engineer, I want unified test execution across local development and
CI/CD pipelines so that test results are consistent and predictable.

The testing infrastructure should work identically whether running locally with
Wallaby, in development with watch mode, or in GitHub Actions CI/CD pipelines.
Coverage reports should be automatically generated and uploaded to Codecov with
proper thresholds enforced.

### Enterprise Security Compliance

As an enterprise architect, I want the testing framework to support
comprehensive security testing and compliance validation so that our codebase
meets regulatory requirements.

The testing setup must support security vulnerability scanning in dependencies,
proper mocking of sensitive operations, and audit trails for test execution. All
testing tools should be from trusted, well-maintained projects with active
security updates.

## Spec Scope

1. **Vitest Configuration** - Complete Vitest setup with optimal configuration
   for Bun runtime, including thread pool optimization and module resolution
   fixes
2. **Wallaby Integration** - Full Wallaby.js configuration with Bun runtime
   support and real-time feedback in VS Code
3. **Mock System Setup** - MSW for API mocking, React Testing Library
   integration, and vi.\* mock utilities configuration
4. **CI/CD Pipeline Updates** - Replace all Bun test jobs with Vitest
   equivalents, including coverage reporting and status checks
5. **Test Migration Tools** - Scripts and documentation for migrating existing
   Bun tests to Vitest format

## Out of Scope

- Migration to Jest or other test runners
- Maintaining dual test runner support (Bun test + Vitest)
- Custom test reporter implementations
- Browser-based E2E testing setup (Playwright/Cypress)
- Performance regression testing infrastructure

## Expected Deliverable

1. All tests execute successfully using `bun run vitest` with 100% of existing
   tests passing
2. Wallaby.js shows real-time test results with inline green/red indicators and
   coverage percentages in VS Code
3. CI/CD pipeline runs Vitest tests with coverage upload to Codecov showing
   minimum 80% coverage
