# Spec Requirements Document

> Spec: Integration Test Mock Refactor
> Created: 2025-09-08

## Overview

Refactor the remaining 10 failing integration tests in config-variations.integration.test.ts to use mock infrastructure instead of real quality checker execution. This will eliminate unexpected output and ensure predictable test results by replacing real tool execution with controlled mock responses.

## User Stories

### Developer Testing Story

As a developer, I want integration tests to run with predictable mock results, so that tests are fast, reliable, and don't depend on external tools or configurations.

The developer runs the test suite and expects all integration tests to pass consistently without requiring actual linting/formatting tools to be installed or configured. Tests should use mock infrastructure to simulate various configuration scenarios (ESLint styles, TypeScript strict modes, Prettier configs) with predetermined results, ensuring tests validate behavior rather than actual tool output.

## Spec Scope

1. **ESLint Configuration Tests** - Refactor 3 tests for different ESLint configurations (Airbnb, Standard, Enterprise) to use mocks
2. **TypeScript Strict Mode Tests** - Convert 3 TypeScript strict mode tests to use mock quality checker with predefined TypeScript errors
3. **Prettier Configuration Tests** - Update 3 Prettier edge case tests to use mock infrastructure for formatting validation
4. **Mixed Configuration Test** - Refactor ESLint/Prettier conflict test to use mocks for both tools

## Out of Scope

- Modifying the actual quality checker implementation
- Changing the mock infrastructure itself
- Updating other test files beyond config-variations.integration.test.ts
- Creating new test cases or scenarios

## Expected Deliverable

1. All 10 failing tests in config-variations.integration.test.ts pass using mock infrastructure
2. Tests run in under 100ms with no dependency on real linting/formatting tools
3. Exit codes and error messages are predictable and match expected test assertions
