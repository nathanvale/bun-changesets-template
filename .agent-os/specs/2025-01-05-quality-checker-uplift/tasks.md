# Spec Tasks

## Fix Skipped Tests in Quality Checker

Date: 2025-09-07
Status: Active

### Overview
This task list addresses skipped and failing tests in the quality checker package to ensure comprehensive test coverage and proper functionality.

## Tasks

- [ ] 1. Fix TypeScript Strict Mode Tests
  - [ ] 1.1 Enable and analyze TypeScript strict null checks test in config-variations.integration.test.ts
  - [ ] 1.2 Update TypeScript engine to handle strict null checks compiler option properly
  - [ ] 1.3 Enable and analyze TypeScript no implicit any test in config-variations.integration.test.ts
  - [ ] 1.4 Update TypeScript engine to handle noImplicitAny compiler option
  - [ ] 1.5 Remove skip modifiers from TypeScript strict mode describe block (line 157)
  - [ ] 1.6 Verify all TypeScript strict mode tests pass

- [ ] 2. Fix Blocking Behavior Tests
  - [ ] 2.1 Enable blocking behavior describe block in claude-hook-workflow.integration.test.ts (line 281)
  - [ ] 2.2 Analyze type safety blocking requirements for should_block_for_type_safety_issues test
  - [ ] 2.3 Update autopilot adapter to properly detect and block type safety issues
  - [ ] 2.4 Analyze complexity blocking requirements for should_block_for_complexity_issues test
  - [ ] 2.5 Update autopilot adapter to properly detect and block complexity issues
  - [ ] 2.6 Verify all blocking behavior tests pass

- [ ] 3. Fix Failing Unit Tests
  - [ ] 3.1 Analyze quality-checker.unit.test.ts TypeScript error handling failure
  - [ ] 3.2 Update error message expectations to match actual TypeScript output
  - [ ] 3.3 Analyze claude.unit.test.ts invalid payload handling failures
  - [ ] 3.4 Fix payload validation in claude facade to handle undefined gracefully
  - [ ] 3.5 Add defensive checks for missing payload properties (tool_name, file_path)
  - [ ] 3.6 Verify all unit tests pass

- [ ] 4. Integration and Performance Validation
  - [ ] 4.1 Run full test suite to ensure no regressions
  - [ ] 4.2 Verify performance benchmarks still pass (sub-300ms requirement)
  - [ ] 4.3 Update test documentation if needed
  - [ ] 4.4 Run linting and type checking (pnpm lint, pnpm typecheck)
  - [ ] 4.5 Ensure all integration tests pass without skips

## Acceptance Criteria

- All previously skipped tests are enabled and passing
- No test regressions in existing test suite
- Performance benchmarks remain within acceptable limits
- Code passes all linting and type checking
- Test coverage maintains or improves from baseline

## Technical Notes

### Affected Files:
- `packages/quality-check/src/integration/config-variations.integration.test.ts`
- `packages/quality-check/src/integration/claude-hook-workflow.integration.test.ts`
- `packages/quality-check/src/core/quality-checker.unit.test.ts`
- `packages/quality-check/src/facades/claude.unit.test.ts`
- `packages/quality-check/src/engines/typescript-engine.ts`
- `packages/quality-check/src/adapters/autopilot.ts`

### Key Components:
- TypeScript Engine: Handles TypeScript compilation and error detection
- Autopilot Adapter: Makes decisions about blocking vs auto-fixing issues
- Claude Facade: Handles Claude hook integration and payload validation
- Quality Checker: Core orchestration of quality checks

## Execution Order

Follow TDD approach:
1. Enable tests first to understand failure modes
2. Implement fixes based on test requirements
3. Verify all tests pass
4. Run integration and performance validation
