# Spec Summary (Lite)

Implement an intelligent Autopilot adapter that classifies code quality issues
into safe/unsafe categories and automatically fixes 80%+ of common issues
without human intervention. The engine uses rule-based classification with three
categories (Always Safe, Context-Dependent, Never Auto), makes smart decisions
based on file context, and ensures zero false positives while maintaining
sub-10ms performance for real-time quality enforcement.
