# Spec Requirements Document

> Spec: Quality Check Package Extraction  
> Created: 2025-09-03  
> Version: 2.0.0  
> Status: Planning

## Overview

Extract and enhance the quality check functionality from
`packages/claude-hooks/src/quality-check` into a production-ready NPM package
`@template/quality-check` that performs ESLint, Prettier, and TypeScript
validation with <2s execution time, atomic file operations, comprehensive
security measures, and simplified Claude Code integration via npx - no global
installation or bin configuration required.

## User Stories

### Simplified Quality Check Integration

As a Claude Code developer, I want to use a lightweight quality check package
without global installation or PATH configuration, so that I can validate files
during development with instant feedback, automatic fixes, and zero
configuration complexity.

**Detailed Workflow:**

1. User adds `@template/quality-check` as a dev dependency (or uses npx
   directly)
2. User configures Claude Code PostToolUse hook with simple
   `npx @template/quality-check` command
3. Claude Code writes/edits a TypeScript file
4. PostToolUse hook triggers with JSON payload containing file path
5. Package auto-detects hook mode via stdin and processes the file
6. Quality checks execute with ESLint, Prettier, TypeScript in <2s using
   parallel processing
7. Atomic file operations ensure safe auto-fixes with backup/restore capability
8. Structured logs with correlation IDs provide full observability
9. Exit codes communicate results back to Claude Code for appropriate handling

### Performance Optimization

As an ADHD developer, I want quality checks to complete in under 2 seconds, so
that I can maintain flow state without cognitive interruptions from slow tooling
feedback loops.

**Detailed Workflow:**

1. Quality check package leverages 2025 performance optimizations
2. ESLint v9.34+ multithread linting provides 30-60% performance boost
3. TypeScript 5.7+ uses Node.js 22 compile cache for 2.5x faster type checking
4. Prettier advanced caching strategies minimize redundant formatting operations
5. Correlation IDs track performance metrics across the validation pipeline
6. All operations complete within 2-second target for optimal ADHD workflow
   support

### Logging and Observability

As a development team lead, I want structured logging with correlation IDs for
all quality check operations, so that I can trace issues, monitor performance,
and understand usage patterns across the team.

**Detailed Workflow:**

1. Each quality check operation generates a unique correlation ID
2. All validation steps (ESLint, Prettier, TypeScript) are logged with
   structured data
3. Performance metrics, error rates, and fix statistics are captured
4. Logs follow Voice Vault patterns using @orchestr8/logger for consistency
5. Integration with existing monitoring systems is seamless
6. Troubleshooting and performance analysis is simplified through correlation
   tracking

### Security and Reliability

As a security-conscious developer, I want file operations to be atomic and
secure, preventing corruption or injection attacks while ensuring reliable
recovery from failures.

**Detailed Workflow:**

1. All file paths are validated to prevent traversal attacks
2. File modifications use atomic writes with backup/restore capability
3. Concurrent access is managed through file locking mechanisms
4. Input is sanitized to prevent command injection
5. Resource limits prevent memory exhaustion or infinite loops
6. Failed operations automatically restore from backups
7. Security events are logged with appropriate severity levels

## Spec Scope

1. **Core Quality Checkers** - Extract and optimize ESLint, Prettier, and
   TypeScript validation with parallel processing and advanced caching
2. **No-Bin Architecture** - Single entry point with npx execution,
   auto-detection of hook mode via stdin, no global installation required
3. **Atomic File Operations** - Safe file modifications with backup/restore,
   file locking, and write verification
4. **Security Hardening** - Path traversal prevention, input sanitization,
   resource limits, and secure environment variable handling
5. **Performance Optimization** - <2s execution with multithread ESLint,
   TypeScript compile cache, and Prettier content caching
6. **Claude Code Integration** - Exit code strategy for communication, version
   compatibility matrix, JSON payload parsing
7. **Structured Logging** - Correlation IDs, performance metrics, debug mode
   with tracing, @orchestr8/logger integration
8. **Git Integration** - Git-aware file processing, pre-commit mode support,
   gitignore respect

## Out of Scope

- AI sub-agent orchestration and complex TDD support from current claude-hooks
  system
- Unit tests (focus on end-to-end integration tests only as specified)
- Multi-file validation (single file checking only)
- Complex configuration system (simple, opinionated defaults)
- UI/browser-based validation (CLI/hook integration only)

## Expected Deliverable

1. **NPM Package `@template/quality-check`** - Standalone package with npx
   execution, no bin or global installation required
2. **Simplified Integration** - Single entry point with auto-detection of hook
   mode via stdin
3. **<2s Performance Validation** - All quality checks complete within 2-second
   target using parallel processing
4. **Atomic File Operations** - Safe auto-fixes with backup/restore capability
   and file locking
5. **Production Security** - Path validation, input sanitization, resource
   limits, secure environment handling
6. **Claude Code Integration** - Exit code communication, version compatibility,
   seamless PostToolUse hook support
7. **Comprehensive Observability** - Structured logging with correlation IDs,
   performance metrics, debug tracing
8. **Migration Guide** - Clear path from claude-hooks with rollback procedures
