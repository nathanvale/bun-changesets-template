> Spec: Fix Integration Test Failures
> Created: 2025-09-08

## Overview

Fix the 4 failing integration tests in the quality-check package that are related to incorrect exit codes and error message formatting. This will restore the test suite to a passing state and ensure the claude hook integration behaves as expected.

## User Stories

### Integration Test Reliability

As a developer, I want all integration tests to pass consistently, so that I can trust the test suite and safely make changes to the codebase.

The current integration tests are failing due to mismatched expectations around exit codes. When the quality checker runs via the Claude hook, it's returning exit code 2 in scenarios where the tests expect exit code 0 (for auto-fixable issues) or specific error messages (for blocking issues).

### Hook Exit Code Consistency  

As a Claude Code user, I want the quality check hook to return appropriate exit codes, so that the tool integration works correctly and doesn't block unnecessarily.

The hook should return exit code 0 when issues are auto-fixed successfully, exit code 2 when manual intervention is required, and provide clear error messages that match the expected format.

## Spec Scope

1. **Exit Code Logic** - Ensure the claude hook returns exit code 0 for successfully auto-fixed issues
2. **Error Message Format** - Align error output format with test expectations for blocking issues
3. **Test Stability** - Update integration tests to accurately reflect the intended behavior
4. **Performance Validation** - Maintain sub-2 second execution time for all operations

## Out of Scope

- Refactoring the entire quality-check architecture
- Adding new quality check features
- Modifying the core ESLint or Prettier engines
- Changing the hook installation process

## Expected Deliverable

1. All 4 failing integration tests pass consistently
2. Exit codes correctly reflect the operation outcome (0 for success/auto-fix, 2 for blocking)
3. Error messages match the expected format in test assertions
