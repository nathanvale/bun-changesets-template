# Spec Requirements Document

> Spec: Enhanced Error Reporting Created: 2025-09-09 Status: Planning

## Overview

Transform quality check error reporting from verbose XML output to efficient JSON file storage with ANSI-colored console summaries, reducing Claude conversation context usage by ~98%. Currently, ESLint and TypeScript errors are displayed as verbose XML directly to console, creating massive context pollution in Claude conversations. This enhancement will store full error details in structured JSON files while showing clean, colored summaries to users, dramatically improving the Claude Code experience while preserving complete error information for tool-based access.

## User Stories

**As a Claude Code user**, I want to see clean, colorful error summaries in my console instead of overwhelming XML dumps, so that I can quickly understand issues without context pollution.

**As a Claude agent**, I want to access structured error data from JSON files instead of parsing verbose console output, so that I can efficiently analyze and respond to quality check failures with minimal context usage.

**As a developer using quality-check**, I want my error logs organized in a dedicated folder structure with automatic cleanup, so that my project stays organized and doesn't accumulate stale log files.

**As a CI/CD system**, I want access to both human-readable summaries and machine-readable error details, so that I can provide appropriate feedback in different contexts.

## Spec Scope

### In Scope
- **Logger Service Enhancements**: Extend existing Logger.ts to support dual output modes (console + file)
- **OutputFormatter Service**: New service for ANSI-colored console output formatting
- **JSON Error Storage**: Replace XML output with structured JSON files in .quality-check/logs/
- **Log Directory Management**: Automated creation and cleanup of log directories
- **Console Output Transformation**: Convert verbose tool output to clean, colored summaries
- **Claude Facade Integration**: Update facades to work with new logging system
- **File Naming Conventions**: Timestamp-based naming with error type prefixes
- **Error Report Schema**: Standardized JSON structure for all quality check errors

### Dependencies
- Pino logger (already in use)
- chalk or similar for ANSI colors
- Existing quality check tools (ESLint, Prettier, TypeScript)
- Current Logger.ts implementation

## Out of Scope

### Explicitly Excluded
- **Underlying Tool Modifications**: No changes to ESLint, Prettier, or TypeScript configurations
- **Autopilot Logic Changes**: No modifications to existing quality check execution flow
- **New Quality Check Rules**: Focus is on reporting, not rule changes
- **Remote Logging**: No cloud logging or external service integration
- **Historical Log Analysis**: No analytics or trending features
- **Configuration Management**: Use existing configuration patterns

## Expected Deliverable

A working error reporting system that:

1. **Shows Clean Console Output**: Users see ANSI-colored summaries instead of verbose XML
2. **Stores Complete Error Details**: Full error information preserved in structured JSON files
3. **Maintains Tool Compatibility**: All existing quality check functionality works unchanged
4. **Provides Efficient Claude Access**: JSON files enable low-context error analysis
5. **Manages Log Lifecycle**: Automatic cleanup prevents log accumulation
6. **Supports Multiple Output Modes**: Silent mode for automated tools, verbose for debugging

Success criteria:
- Context usage reduced by 98% for typical error scenarios
- All error information remains accessible through JSON files
- Console output is colorful and concise
- No breaking changes to existing API
- Log files are properly organized and cleaned up
