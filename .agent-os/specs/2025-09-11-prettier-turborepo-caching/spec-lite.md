# Prettier Turborepo Caching - Lite Summary

Implement Turborepo caching for Prettier formatting to achieve 22x performance improvements through dual-hash caching and content-aware fingerprinting. Configure local and remote caching with optimized turbo.json settings, enable incremental formatting with Git-based change detection, and establish team-wide cache sharing via Vercel or self-hosted solutions. Target 80%+ cache hit rates for unchanged packages, reducing formatting times from 10-30 seconds to under 3 seconds for typical changesets while cutting CI/CD pipeline times by 65-80%.
