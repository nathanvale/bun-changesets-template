These are the tasks to be completed for the spec detailed in
@.agent-os/specs/2025-09-11-prettier-turborepo-caching/spec.md

> Created: 2025-09-16 Status: Ready for Implementation

## Tasks

- [ ] 1. Turborepo Configuration for Prettier Caching
  - [ ] 1.1 Write tests for turbo.json configuration validation and cache key
        generation
  - [ ] 1.2 Configure root-level turbo.json with format and format:check tasks
  - [ ] 1.3 Set up comprehensive input patterns covering source files and
        configuration
  - [ ] 1.4 Implement composite cache keys with HMAC-SHA256 signatures
  - [ ] 1.5 Configure output logs with errors-only for CI and new-only for
        development
  - [ ] 1.6 Set up task dependencies ensuring format runs before lint operations
  - [ ] 1.7 Configure hierarchical cache organization in .turbo/cache directory
  - [ ] 1.8 Verify all tests pass and cache configuration works correctly

- [ ] 2. Local Caching Setup and Optimization
  - [ ] 2.1 Write tests for local cache storage, LRU eviction, and compression
  - [ ] 2.2 Configure local cache storage in .turbo/cache with proper structure
  - [ ] 2.3 Implement LRU eviction policies for cache management
  - [ ] 2.4 Set up compressed tarball artifacts for efficient storage
  - [ ] 2.5 Configure content-aware hashing that ignores file metadata
  - [ ] 2.6 Enable parallel task execution across available CPU cores
  - [ ] 2.7 Implement cache hit rate targeting 80%+ for unchanged packages
  - [ ] 2.8 Verify all tests pass and local caching performs as expected

- [ ] 3. Remote Cache Integration
  - [ ] 3.1 Write tests for remote cache authentication, upload/download, and
        security
  - [ ] 3.2 Configure Vercel Remote Cache with zero-configuration setup
  - [ ] 3.3 Implement HMAC-SHA256 artifact signing with
        TURBO_REMOTE_CACHE_SIGNATURE_KEY
  - [ ] 3.4 Set up team-based authentication with JWT tokens
  - [ ] 3.5 Configure parallel uploads/downloads for optimal performance
  - [ ] 3.6 Implement content-addressed storage to prevent duplicate artifacts
  - [ ] 3.7 Set up CI/CD environment variables (TURBO_TOKEN, TURBO_TEAM)
  - [ ] 3.8 Verify all tests pass and remote cache sharing works across
        environments

- [ ] 4. Incremental Formatting Implementation
  - [ ] 4.1 Write tests for Git-based change detection and --affected flag
        functionality
  - [ ] 4.2 Implement --affected flag support for Turborepo 2.1+
  - [ ] 4.3 Configure TURBO_SCM_BASE environment variable for CI environments
  - [ ] 4.4 Set up filter patterns for branch comparisons
  - [ ] 4.5 Enable workspace-level filtering for targeted operations
  - [ ] 4.6 Configure fetch-depth: 2 in CI checkout for proper change detection
  - [ ] 4.7 Implement Git integration for detecting modified files
  - [ ] 4.8 Verify all tests pass and incremental formatting reduces execution
        time

- [ ] 5. Performance Monitoring and Developer Experience
  - [ ] 5.1 Write tests for cache hit rate tracking, performance metrics, and
        IDE integration
  - [ ] 5.2 Implement cache hit rate tracking and reporting mechanisms
  - [ ] 5.3 Configure Turborepo analytics for performance insights
  - [ ] 5.4 Set up invalidation pattern monitoring and time savings metrics
  - [ ] 5.5 Monitor remote cache upload/download performance
  - [ ] 5.6 Configure IDE formatting to work alongside Turborepo caching
  - [ ] 5.7 Set up pre-commit hooks with direct Prettier execution
  - [ ] 5.8 Verify all tests pass and performance targets are met (80%+ cache
        hits, <3s formatting)
