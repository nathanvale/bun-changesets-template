  - [x] 2.6 Enable parallel task execution across available CPU cores
  - [x] 2.7 Implement cache hit rate targeting 80%+ for unchanged packages
  - [x] 2.8 Verify all tests pass and local caching performs as expected

- [x] 3. Remote Cache Integration

        security
  - [x] 3.2 Configure Vercel Remote Cache with zero-configuration setup
  - [x] 3.3 Implement HMAC-SHA256 artifact signing with
        TURBO_REMOTE_CACHE_SIGNATURE_KEY
  - [x] 3.4 Set up team-based authentication with JWT tokens
  - [x] 3.5 Configure parallel uploads/downloads for optimal performance
  - [x] 3.6 Implement content-addressed storage to prevent duplicate artifacts
  - [x] 3.7 Set up CI/CD environment variables (TURBO_TOKEN, TURBO_TEAM)
  - [x] 3.8 Verify all tests pass and remote cache sharing works across
        environments

- [x] 4. Incremental Formatting Implementation

  - [x] 4.4 Set up filter patterns for branch comparisons
  - [x] 4.5 Enable workspace-level filtering for targeted operations
  - [x] 4.6 Configure fetch-depth: 2 in CI checkout for proper change detection
  - [x] 4.7 Implement Git integration for detecting modified files
  - [x] 4.8 Verify all tests pass and incremental formatting reduces execution
        time

- [x] 5. Performance Monitoring and Developer Experience
  - [x] 5.1 Write tests for cache hit rate tracking, performance metrics, and
        IDE integration
  - [x] 5.2 Implement cache hit rate tracking and reporting mechanisms
  - [x] 5.3 Configure Turborepo analytics for performance insights
  - [x] 5.4 Set up invalidation pattern monitoring and time savings metrics
