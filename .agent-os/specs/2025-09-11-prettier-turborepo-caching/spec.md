> Spec: Prettier with Turborepo Caching Optimization Created: 2025-09-11 Status:
> Planning

## Overview

Implement Turborepo caching for Prettier formatting operations to achieve
dramatic performance improvements (22x speedups) through intelligent dual-hash
caching mechanisms and content-aware fingerprinting. This feature will transform
slow formatting tasks into millisecond-range cached operations, significantly
reducing CI/CD pipeline times and improving developer productivity.

## User Stories

### Development Team Formatting Performance

As a development team member, I want to run Prettier formatting with
near-instant cached results, so that I can maintain code consistency without
impacting my development workflow.

The developer runs formatting commands through Turborepo which creates
deterministic fingerprints for each formatting task. When files haven't changed,
formatting operations complete in milliseconds by restoring cached results. The
system tracks source files, configurations, and dependencies to ensure cache
validity while maximizing hit rates approaching 99% for unchanged packages.

### CI/CD Pipeline Optimization

As a DevOps engineer, I want to reduce CI pipeline times by 65-80% through
cached formatting operations, so that deployments complete faster and resource
costs decrease.

The CI system leverages both local and remote caching to share formatting
results across builds. GitHub Actions or other CI providers authenticate with
Turborepo's remote cache, retrieving pre-computed formatting results for
unchanged code. This reduces typical formatting operations from 10-30 seconds to
under 3 seconds for standard changesets.

### Monorepo Team Collaboration

As a monorepo team lead, I want shared formatting cache across all team members
and CI environments, so that formatting operations are consistent and efficient
regardless of where they run.

Teams use Vercel's zero-configuration remote cache or self-hosted S3 solutions
to share formatting results. The system employs HMAC-SHA256 signatures for
artifact integrity, ensuring secure cache sharing while maintaining
millisecond-range restoration times for cached operations.

## Spec Scope

1. **Turborepo Configuration** - Implement optimized turbo.json configuration
   with comprehensive input patterns and cache settings for format and
   format:check tasks
2. **Local Caching Setup** - Configure local cache storage in .turbo/cache with
   LRU eviction policies and compressed tarball artifacts
3. **Remote Cache Integration** - Set up remote caching using Vercel's service
   or self-hosted solutions with proper authentication and security
4. **Incremental Formatting** - Enable Git-based change detection with
   --affected flags for formatting only modified files
5. **Performance Monitoring** - Implement cache hit rate tracking and
   performance analytics to optimize caching strategies

## Out of Scope

- Custom formatting rules or Prettier configuration changes
- Migration from existing non-Turborepo formatting setups
- IDE-specific formatting integrations beyond basic configuration
- Machine learning or AI-based pattern detection for formatting
- Real-time formatting in watch mode (experimental feature)

## Expected Deliverable

1. Functioning Turborepo configuration achieving 80%+ cache hit rates for
   unchanged packages with measurable performance improvements
2. Working remote cache integration allowing team-wide sharing of formatting
   results with proper security and authentication
3. Documented incremental formatting workflow using --affected flags reducing
   typical formatting from 10-30 seconds to under 3 seconds
