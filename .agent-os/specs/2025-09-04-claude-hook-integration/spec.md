# Spec Requirements Document

> Spec: Claude Hook Integration Created: 2025-09-04 Status: Planning

## Overview

Implement a Claude Code PostToolUse hook integration that provides intelligent
three-tier error classification and automated fixing for TypeScript/JavaScript
files, enabling seamless AI-assisted development with minimal developer
interruption.

## User Stories

### AI Assistant Claude Integration

As Claude (AI Assistant), I want to automatically validate and fix code quality
issues when users write files, so that I can provide high-quality code
generation with minimal human intervention.

**Workflow:** When a user asks Claude to write/edit a file → Claude executes the
write operation → PostToolUse hook runs quality-check → Auto-fixable issues get
silently resolved → Claude-fixable issues trigger a blocking message with
specific fix instructions → Human-required issues stop execution with
educational context.

### Senior Developer Sarah - Team Quality Enforcement

As a Senior Developer, I want Claude Code to enforce our team's quality
standards automatically, so that I can spend 50% less time in code reviews
catching the same formatting and typing errors.

**Workflow:** Team member uses Claude to generate component → Hook detects
missing TypeScript types → Claude receives specific instructions to add proper
type annotations → Code gets automatically corrected → Senior developer never
sees the original error-prone code.

### Junior Developer James - Learning Through Enforcement

As a Junior Developer, I want to learn from quality errors in real-time through
Claude, so that I can build deep understanding of TypeScript and ESLint best
practices without repeatedly making the same mistakes.

**Workflow:** Uses Claude to create function → Hook detects complex error
requiring human understanding → Claude explains the issue with educational
context → Junior developer learns the pattern → Future similar errors get caught
before reaching the developer.

## Spec Scope

1. **Claude Hook Wrapper** - Create lightweight hooks/claude-hook.js (~50 lines)
   that interfaces between Claude Code and quality-check package
2. **Three-Tier Classification** - Implement intelligent error classification
   system (Auto-fixable → Silent, Claude-fixable → Block+Fix, Human-required →
   Stop+Educate)
3. **Hook Payload Processing** - Parse Claude Code PostToolUse JSON payloads via
   stdin and extract file operation details
4. **Silent Success Mode** - Ensure auto-fixed issues provide zero output while
   maintaining logging for debugging
5. **Performance Optimization** - Maintain sub-2s execution time for
   ADHD-optimized workflow

## Out of Scope

- Modifications to existing quality-check core architecture
- Integration with other AI coding assistants (VS Code Copilot, etc.)
- Real-time file watching or continuous monitoring
- Integration with CI/CD pipelines (handled by existing git-hook facade)

## Expected Deliverable

1. **Functional Hook Integration** - Claude Code can write files and
   automatically trigger quality validation with appropriate responses
2. **Three-Tier Classification Working** - Different error types receive
   appropriate handling (silent fix, block+fix, stop+educate)
3. **Performance Verification** - Hook execution completes in under 2 seconds
   for typical file operations
