Systematically resolve critical CI pipeline failures (voice-vault dependencies,
type checks, builds, tests, commit lint) that emerged after successful CI ADHD
optimization implementation, while preserving the working modular job
architecture.

## Key Points

- Fix missing voice-vault dependencies (@orchestr8/logger, openai,
  @elevenlabs/elevenlabs-js) causing import failures
- Resolve TypeScript type check issues and cascading build failures
- Restore cross-platform test execution reliability (Ubuntu, macOS, Windows)
