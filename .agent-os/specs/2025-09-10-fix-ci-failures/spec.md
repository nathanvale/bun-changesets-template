> Spec: Fix CI Failures After ADHD Optimization Created: 2025-09-10 Status:
> Planning

## Overview

Fix critical CI pipeline failures that emerged after implementing the modular CI
ADHD optimization while preserving the successful Setup, Lint, and Format job
architecture. The failures stem from missing voice-vault dependencies, type
check issues, and cascading build/test failures across platforms.

## User Stories

1. **As a developer**, I want CI pipelines to pass consistently so that I can
   merge PRs and maintain development velocity without being blocked by
   infrastructure issues.

2. **As a team member**, I want dependency resolution to work correctly so that
   all packages build successfully and type checking passes without false
   negatives.

3. **As a contributor**, I want tests to run reliably across all supported
   platforms (Ubuntu, macOS, Windows) so that platform-specific issues are
   caught early and consistently.

## Spec Scope

1. **Resolve voice-vault dependency issues** - Fix missing dependencies
   (@orchestr8/logger, openai, @elevenlabs/elevenlabs-js) that are causing
   import failures
2. **Fix type check failures** - Ensure all TypeScript type checking passes by
   resolving missing dependency types and imports
3. **Restore build pipeline functionality** - Address cascading build failures
   that stem from unresolved dependencies
4. **Fix cross-platform test execution** - Ensure tests pass consistently on
   Ubuntu, macOS, and Windows environments
5. **Resolve commit lint configuration** - Fix any commit lint issues that may
   be blocking the pipeline

## Out of Scope

- Modifying the successful modular CI job structure (Setup, Lint, Format jobs
  are working correctly)
- Adding new features or functionality beyond fixing existing failures
- Performance optimizations beyond what's needed to restore functionality
- Changing the overall CI ADHD optimization architecture

## Expected Deliverable

1. **All CI pipeline jobs pass consistently** - Every job in the CI pipeline
   completes successfully without dependency, build, or test failures
2. **Cross-platform compatibility restored** - Tests and builds work reliably
   across Ubuntu, macOS, and Windows environments
3. **Clean dependency resolution** - All package dependencies are properly
   installed and available, with no missing import errors
