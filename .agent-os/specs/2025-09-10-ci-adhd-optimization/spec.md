> Spec: CI Pipeline ADHD Optimization Created: 2025-09-10

## Overview

Redesign the CI pipeline to reduce cognitive load by 40-50% through modular job
architecture, visual feedback systems, and progressive testing strategies. This
improvement will transform the complex monolithic CI into an ADHD-friendly
system that provides clear, immediate feedback while maintaining comprehensive
quality gates.

## User Stories

### Developer with ADHD Running CI

As a developer with ADHD, I want to see immediate, visual CI feedback with clear
pass/fail indicators, so that I can quickly understand what's broken without
parsing walls of logs.

The developer pushes code and sees a simple progress table in their PR showing
each check's status with emojis. When something fails, they get a specific
comment with the exact command to fix it locally, eliminating the need to dig
through logs or guess at solutions.

### Team Lead Monitoring Pipeline Health

As a team lead, I want modular CI jobs that can be understood at a glance, so
that I can quickly identify bottlenecks and optimize our pipeline without deep
analysis.

The team lead opens the Actions tab and sees clearly named jobs (Lint, Format,
Types, Build, Test) each with single responsibilities. Performance metrics are
visible in step summaries, making it easy to spot slowdowns.

## Spec Scope

1. **Job Modularization** - Split the monolithic quality job into 4 focused jobs
   with single responsibilities
2. **Progressive Testing** - Implement quick smoke tests (30s) before full test
   suites for faster feedback
3. **Visual Feedback System** - Add GitHub step summaries, PR comments, and
   emoji-based status indicators
4. **Performance Optimizations** - Fix caching logic, remove fake scripts, add
   real performance metrics
5. **Failure Recovery** - Provide specific fix commands and hints when checks
   fail

## Out of Scope

- Migration to different CI platforms (staying with GitHub Actions)
- Adding new testing frameworks or tools
- Changing the monorepo structure
- Modifying deployment workflows

## Expected Deliverable

1. CI pipeline that provides initial feedback within 1 minute for typical PRs
2. Clear visual status indicators accessible without clicking into job logs
3. Automatic remediation instructions posted as PR comments when failures occur
