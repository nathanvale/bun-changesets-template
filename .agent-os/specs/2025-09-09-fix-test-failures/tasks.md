# Spec Tasks

These are the tasks to be completed for the spec detailed in
@.agent-os/specs/2025-09-09-fix-test-failures/spec.md

> Created: 2025-09-09 Status: Ready for Implementation

## Tasks

- [x] 1. Fix Error Message Transformation Issues
  - [x] 1.1 Write tests to verify error message preservation
  - [x] 1.2 Fix error handling in quality-checker.ts lines 159-176 to preserve original error messages
  - [x] 1.3 Ensure 'File resolution failed' errors are not transformed to 'Config load failed'
  - [x] 1.4 Fix handling of non-Error objects and circular references
  - [x] 1.5 Verify all error transformation tests pass

- [x] 2. Implement Timeout and Resource Management
  - [x] 2.1 Write tests for timeout detection mechanisms
  - [x] 2.2 Implement proper timeout handling that causes check failures when expected
  - [x] 2.3 Add memory pressure detection and handling
  - [x] 2.4 Implement graceful handling of large file lists
  - [x] 2.5 Verify all timeout and resource management tests pass

- [x] 3. Implement Graceful Degradation for Missing Tools
  - [x] 3.1 Write tests for graceful degradation scenarios
  - [x] 3.2 Modify quality-checker to continue with available tools when some are missing
  - [x] 3.3 Ensure missing tools don't cause complete failures
  - [x] 3.4 Verify all graceful degradation tests pass

- [x] 4. Final Integration and Validation
  - [x] 4.1 Run all quality-check tests to ensure no regressions
  - [x] 4.2 Verify all 9 failing tests now pass
  - [x] 4.3 Run full test suite to ensure no other tests broken
  - [x] 4.4 Commit the fixes with appropriate message

## Implementation Notes

### Focus Areas

The focus is on fixing the specific error handling issues in packages/quality-check/src/core/quality-checker.ts that are causing the 9 test failures in the error-handling test suite.

### Key Issues to Address

1. **Error Message Transformation**: Error messages are being incorrectly transformed, losing original context
2. **Timeout Detection**: Tests expect timeout scenarios to be properly detected and handled
3. **Resource Management**: Large file lists and memory pressure need proper handling
4. **Tool Availability**: Quality checker should gracefully degrade when tools are missing

### Testing Strategy

- Run tests after each subtask completion
- Use `bun test --verbose` for detailed output when debugging
- Focus specifically on the error-handling test suite
- Isolate test failures to specific components before fixing

### Completion Criteria

- All 9 failing tests in error-handling test suite pass
- No regression in other test suites
- Quality checker maintains expected functionality
