# Spec Requirements Document

> Spec: Fix Quality-Check Test Failures Created: 2025-09-09 Status: Planning

## Overview

Fix 11 failing tests in the quality-check package while maintaining the 478
passing tests. The failing tests are primarily related to error message
transformation, mock file system configuration, output formatting for blocking
messages, and empty array handling that returns incorrect success status.

## User Stories

**As a developer working on the quality-check package**, I want all tests to
pass consistently so that I can confidently make changes without breaking
existing functionality.

**As a CI/CD pipeline**, I need all 489 tests to pass so that automated builds
and deployments can proceed without manual intervention.

**As a maintainer of the quality-check system**, I want reliable test coverage
so that regressions are caught early and the codebase remains stable.

## Spec Scope

- Fix error message transformation logic to match test expectations
- Resolve mock file system issues with non-existent paths (e.g., /src/test.ts)
- Correct output formatting for blocking messages
- Fix empty array handling to return proper success status
- Ensure all 11 failing tests pass without breaking the 478 existing passing
  tests
- Maintain current test structure and approach
- Preserve existing functionality and behavior

## Out of Scope

- Architecture changes or refactoring of core quality-check logic
- Adding new features or capabilities
- Modifying test frameworks or testing infrastructure
- Performance optimizations beyond what's needed for test fixes
- Changes to external dependencies or package versions

## Expected Deliverable

- All 489 tests in the quality-check package passing consistently
- No regression in the 478 currently passing tests
- Clean test output with no warnings or errors
- Maintained code coverage levels
- Documentation of specific fixes applied to each failure category
