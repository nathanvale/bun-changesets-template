# Spec Summary (Lite)

Migrate the quality-check package from V1 to V2 implementation, consolidating
the codebase and improving test coverage from 46.61% to >60%. This migration
unifies all facades to use the performant V2 architecture (<300ms warm runs)
while maintaining backward compatibility, removing deprecated code, and ensuring
consistent behavior across CLI, API, and Git hook entry points.
