> Spec: Quality Checker V2 Migration
> Created: 2025-09-08

## Overview

Migrate the quality-check package from the V1 implementation to the V2 implementation, consolidating the codebase and improving test coverage. This migration will unify the dual implementations, remove deprecated code, and ensure all facades use the more performant V2 architecture while maintaining backward compatibility.

## User Stories

### Developer Experience Enhancement

As a developer using the quality-check package, I want a single, unified implementation that provides consistent behavior across all entry points (CLI, API, Git hooks), so that I can rely on predictable quality enforcement without worrying about which version is being used.

The current dual implementation (V1 and V2) creates confusion and maintenance overhead. By migrating to V2, developers will experience faster performance (<300ms warm runs), better error reporting, and more reliable quality checks across all integration points.

### AI Assistant Integration

As an AI coding assistant (like Claude), I want to use a quality checker with a simple, well-tested API facade, so that I can automatically enforce code quality standards without complex configuration or version management.

The V2 implementation provides a cleaner facade pattern that makes it easier for AI assistants to integrate quality checks into their workflow, ensuring consistent code quality enforcement in AI-assisted development.

## Spec Scope

1. **Facade Migration** - Update all facade implementations (api.ts, git-hook.ts, test-utils) to use QualityCheckerV2 exclusively
2. **Test Coverage Port** - Migrate all V1 test coverage to V2, ensuring coverage increases from 46.61% to >60%
3. **Implementation Consolidation** - Remove V1 implementation files and rename V2 to become the primary implementation
4. **Reference Updates** - Update all imports, exports, and references throughout the codebase to use the consolidated implementation
5. **Performance Validation** - Verify <300ms warm run performance and test all integration points (CLI, API, Git hooks)

## Out of Scope

- Adding new features or functionality to the quality checker
- Changing the external API or breaking backward compatibility
- Modifying the facade pattern architecture
- Updating documentation beyond migration notes
- Changing the underlying ESLint or TypeScript configurations

## Expected Deliverable

1. All facades using the consolidated V2 implementation with passing tests
2. Test coverage increased to >60% with all critical paths covered
3. Performance benchmark showing <300ms warm runs and successful integration tests across all entry points
