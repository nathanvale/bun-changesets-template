> Spec: Comprehensive DX Cleanup & Code Smell Elimination Created: 2025-08-31
> Status: Planning

## Overview

Implement a comprehensive developer experience cleanup to eliminate code smells,
reduce cognitive load, and establish robust coding standards across the
monorepo. This initiative will transform the codebase from having scattered
technical debt to a pristine, maintainable, and ADHD-optimized development
environment with zero tolerance for code smells.

## User Stories

### Enterprise Developer Story

As an **Enterprise Developer**, I want to work in a codebase with zero `any`
types and comprehensive error handling, so that I can maintain production-grade
code quality and catch issues at compile time rather than runtime.

Working in enterprise environments requires strict type safety and predictable
error handling. Currently, the codebase has multiple instances of `any` types
that undermine TypeScript's benefits, and inconsistent error handling patterns
that make debugging production issues challenging. After this cleanup, I'll have
confidence that the type system catches potential bugs before they reach
production, and errors are handled consistently with proper logging and recovery
strategies.

### ADHD Developer Story

As an **ADHD Developer**, I want a single-command development startup and
organized script discovery, so that I can maintain flow state without getting
overwhelmed by complex setup procedures or hunting through 94+ unorganized
scripts.

Context switching is cognitively expensive for developers with ADHD. The current
requirement for multiple terminal windows and manual service coordination breaks
flow state before coding even begins. With unified commands and organized
scripts, I can start coding within seconds and find the right command without
decision paralysis, maintaining focus on the actual development work.

### Security-Conscious Developer Story

As a **Security-Conscious Developer**, I want fully functional SBOM generation
and comprehensive vulnerability scanning, so that I can ensure supply chain
security compliance and track component vulnerabilities effectively.

Security compliance requires accurate Software Bill of Materials (SBOM)
generation, which is currently failing due to ESM/CommonJS compatibility issues.
This blocks our ability to track vulnerabilities in our dependency tree. After
remediation, we'll have complete visibility into our supply chain security
posture with automated scanning and baseline tracking.

## Spec Scope

1. **Type Safety Overhaul** - Eliminate all `any` types, add explicit return
   types to every function, implement strict boolean expressions, and establish
   type guard patterns throughout the codebase.

2. **Script Organization & Discovery** - Reorganize 94+ package.json scripts
   into logical categories, create an interactive script explorer, implement
   unified development commands, and add comprehensive script documentation.

3. **Error Handling Standardization** - Create centralized error handling
   utilities, implement custom error classes, standardize logging patterns, and
   ensure consistent error recovery strategies across all scripts and
   applications.

4. **Security Remediation** - Fix critical SBOM generation failure, enhance
   supply chain security scanning, implement input sanitization patterns, and
   establish security baseline tracking.

5. **Build & Configuration Cleanup** - Consolidate duplicated configurations,
   optimize Turborepo and CI/CD pipelines, standardize build processes, and
   implement intelligent caching strategies.

## Out of Scope

- Adding new features or functionality beyond DX improvements
- Major architectural changes or framework migrations
- Database schema modifications or API redesigns
- Third-party service integrations
- UI/UX redesigns or component library changes

## Expected Deliverable

1. **Zero `any` types remaining in the codebase** - Every instance replaced with
   proper TypeScript types, with type coverage reports showing 100% type safety.

2. **Functional SBOM generation producing valid CycloneDX output** - Security
   scans passing in CI/CD with component count >300 and vulnerability tracking
   operational.

3. **Single-command development startup with <10s total initialization** - All
   services orchestrated through `pnpm dev:all` with automatic port conflict
   resolution and health checks.

4. **Organized script discovery system with categorized commands** - Interactive
   help system, logical groupings, and clear documentation for all 94+ scripts.

5. **85% minimum test coverage maintained** - All cleanup changes covered by
   tests, with coverage ratcheting preventing regression.
