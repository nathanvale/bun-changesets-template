> Comprehensive validation checklist for DX cleanup implementation Version:
> 1.0.0 Created: 2025-08-31

## Overview

This checklist ensures all cleanup tasks are properly implemented, tested, and
validated. Each section includes specific acceptance criteria and verification
commands.

## Pre-Implementation Validation

### Environment Setup

- [ ] Node.js 20.x LTS installed

  ```bash
  node --version # Should show v20.x.x
  ```

- [ ] pnpm 9.x installed

  ```bash
  pnpm --version # Should show 9.x.x
  ```

- [ ] All Bun artifacts removed

  ```bash
  # Should return no results
  find . -name "bun.lockb" -o -name "bunfig.toml" -o -name "*bun-types*"
  ```

- [ ] Clean dependency installation
  ```bash
  rm -rf node_modules pnpm-lock.yaml
  pnpm install
  # Should complete without errors
  ```

### Baseline Metrics

- [ ] Capture current metrics

  ```bash
  # Record these values for comparison
  pnpm dx:status
  pnpm test --coverage
  time pnpm build:all
  ```

- [ ] Document current type errors

  ```bash
  pnpm typecheck 2>&1 | tee type-errors-baseline.txt
  # Count: grep -c "error TS" type-errors-baseline.txt
  ```

- [ ] Count `any` types
  ```bash
  grep -r "any" --include="*.ts" --include="*.tsx" . | grep -v node_modules | wc -l
  ```

## Type Safety Validation

### TypeScript Strict Mode

- [ ] No `any` types remaining

  ```bash
  # Should return 0
  grep -r ": any" --include="*.ts" --include="*.tsx" packages apps | wc -l
  ```

- [ ] All functions have return types

  ```bash
  # Check for missing return types (manual review needed)
  grep -E "function \w+\([^)]*\)[^:{\n]" --include="*.ts" --include="*.tsx" -r .
  ```

- [ ] Strict boolean expressions pass

  ```bash
  pnpm lint:strict
  # Should show no strict-boolean-expressions errors
  ```

- [ ] No floating promises
  ```bash
  # Should pass without no-floating-promises errors
  pnpm lint | grep "no-floating-promises"
  ```

### Type Coverage

- [ ] Type coverage meets threshold

  ```bash
  npx type-coverage --detail
  # Should be > 95%
  ```

- [ ] No implicit any in test files
  ```bash
  pnpm tsc --noEmit --strict
  # Should complete without errors
  ```

## Script Organization Validation

### Script Discovery

- [ ] Interactive help system works

  ```bash
  pnpm dx:help
  # Should display categorized scripts
  ```

- [ ] All scripts categorized

  ```bash
  # Verify package.json has organized script sections
  cat package.json | jq '.scripts | keys' | wc -l
  # Should be < 30 top-level scripts
  ```

- [ ] Script documentation complete
  ```bash
  # Each script should have a description
  pnpm run --help
  ```

### Command Validation

- [ ] Core commands work

  ```bash
  pnpm dev          # Should start all services
  pnpm test         # Should run all tests
  pnpm build:all    # Should build all packages
  pnpm dx:status    # Should show project status
  ```

- [ ] DX commands functional
  ```bash
  pnpm dx:idea      # Should open idea capture
  pnpm dx:snapshot  # Should save session
  pnpm dx:resume    # Should restore session
  ```

## Error Handling Validation

### Error Classes

- [ ] Custom error classes created

  ```bash
  # Should exist
  ls scripts/lib/errors.ts
  ```

- [ ] Errors have proper context
  ```typescript
  // Test error context
  const error = new ValidationError('Test', 'field')
  console.log(error.toJSON())
  // Should include: name, message, code, timestamp, context
  ```

### Logging System

- [ ] Structured logger implemented

  ```bash
  # Should exist
  ls scripts/lib/logger.ts
  ```

- [ ] Log levels work correctly
  ```bash
  LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG pnpm test 2>&1 | grep "DEBUG"
  # Should show debug logs
  ```

### Retry Logic

- [ ] Retry utilities functional

  ```bash
  # Should exist
  ls scripts/lib/retry.ts
  ```

- [ ] Exponential backoff works
  ```typescript
  // Test retry with failure
  await retry(() => Promise.reject(new Error('Test')), {
    maxAttempts: 3,
    initialDelay: 100,
  })
  // Should retry 3 times with increasing delays
  ```

## Security Validation

### SBOM Generation

- [ ] SBOM generation fixed

  ```bash
  pnpm security:scan
  # Should generate security-sbom.json
  ```

- [ ] SBOM validates correctly

  ```bash
  # Check SBOM format
  cat security-sbom.json | jq '.bomFormat'
  # Should output "CycloneDX"
  ```

- [ ] Component count adequate
  ```bash
  cat security-sbom.json | jq '.components | length'
  # Should be > 300
  ```

### Vulnerability Scanning

  ```bash
  pnpm audit
  # Should show no high/critical vulnerabilities
  ```

- [ ] License compliance checked
  ```bash
  pnpm licenses list
  # Should not include GPL, AGPL licenses
  ```

### Input Sanitization

- [ ] Command injection prevented

  ```bash
  # Test command sanitization
  node -e "require('./scripts/lib/command-utils').safeExecute('ls', ['.; rm -rf /'])"
  # Should reject with error
  ```

- [ ] Path traversal blocked
  ```bash
  # Test path traversal
  node -e "require('./scripts/lib/path-utils').safePath('../../etc/passwd', '.')"
  # Should throw error
  ```

## Build System Validation

### Turbo Cache

- [ ] Remote cache configured

  ```bash
  cat .turbo/config.json
  # Should have teamId and apiUrl
  ```

- [ ] Cache hit rate improved

  ```bash
  pnpm build:all
  pnpm build:all # Run again
  # Second run should show "cache hit" for all tasks
  ```

  ```bash
  TURBO_DRY_RUN=true pnpm build
  # Should show cache analysis
  ```

### Build Performance

- [ ] Build time < 2s (warm)

  time pnpm build:all
  # Should complete in < 2 seconds
  ```

- [ ] Parallel builds work
  ```bash
  pnpm turbo build --concurrency=4
  # Should use parallel execution
  ```

### Export Maps

- [ ] All packages have valid exports

  ```bash
  # Check each package.json
  for pkg in packages/*/package.json apps/*/package.json; do
    cat $pkg | jq '.exports'
  done
  # All should have proper export maps
  ```

- [ ] TypeScript resolution works
  ```bash

  # Should be >= 85%
  ```

### Test Configuration

- [ ] Vitest multi-project works

  ```bash
  pnpm test --project=utils
  pnpm test --project=web
  # Each should run respective tests
  ```

- [ ] Test sharding functional
  ```bash
  pnpm test -- --shard=1/2
  pnpm test -- --shard=2/2
  # Should split test execution
  ```
