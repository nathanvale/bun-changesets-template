# Spec Requirements Document

> Spec: Build System Optimization Created: 2025-08-31 Status: Planning

## Overview

Optimize and standardize the current tsup + TypeScript + Turborepo build system
to eliminate critical maintenance risks and configuration inconsistencies that
impact ADHD-optimized developer experience. This initiative will address
P0/P1/P2 issues including dependency on unmaintained tooling, configuration
conflicts, build quality improvements, and performance bottlenecks while
maintaining sub-5s feedback loops and single mental model principles.

## User Stories

### ADHD Developer Build Confidence

As an ADHD developer, I want consistent and predictable build behavior across
all packages, so that I can maintain focus and flow without being disrupted by
build configuration complexity or unexpected failures.

**Detailed Workflow**: Developer runs `pnpm build:all` and receives consistent,
fast feedback (<2s target) with clear visual indicators. No cognitive load from
understanding different build behaviors per package. Build errors are clear and
actionable, not buried in configuration complexity.

### Enterprise Team Stability

As a tech lead managing an enterprise team, I want a clear migration strategy
away from unmaintained dependencies, so that I can ensure long-term stability
and avoid technical debt accumulation.

**Detailed Workflow**: Team receives documentation of current risks, timeline
for addressing P0 strategic issues, and confidence that build system will remain
stable and maintainable. Clear documentation of why each configuration choice
was made.

### Monorepo Package Developer

As a developer adding new packages to the monorepo, I want zero-config package
creation with standardized build behavior, so that I can ship features without
wrestling with build configuration.

**Detailed Workflow**: Developer runs package scaffolder, gets consistent tsup
configuration automatically applied, and can immediately start building features
without build system decisions or debugging.

## Spec Scope

1. **Configuration Audit & Cleanup** - Eliminate redundant externals, fix
   splitting inconsistencies, and standardize configuration patterns
2. **Strategic Risk Mitigation** - Document tsup maintenance status and create
   contingency plan for future migration
3. **sideEffects Validation** - Audit all packages for side effects to ensure
   tree-shaking safety
4. **Entry/Export Alignment** - Fix naming mismatches between build entries and
   export subpaths
5. **ADHD Performance Optimization** - Optimize build speed to maintain <2s warm
   builds and clear feedback
6. **Turborepo Cache Optimization** - Remove phantom output directories and
   improve cache hit rates
7. **Bundle Analysis Integration** - Implement metafile consumption for size
   regression detection
8. **Build Quality Improvements** - Disable library minification for better
   debuggability and stack traces
9. **Platform Targeting Optimization** - Update React packages to use browser
   platform for better optimizations
10. **TypeScript Config Alignment** - Add explicit tsconfig references to
    prevent build setting divergence
11. **ESM Optimization Strategy** - Plan separate ESM-only builds with optimal
    tree-shaking
12. **Migration Documentation** - Document complete tsup â†’ tsdown/rolldown
    migration path

## Out of Scope

- Complete rewrite of build system
- Changes to testing infrastructure (Vitest)
- Next.js application build configuration changes
- CI/CD pipeline modifications

## Expected Deliverable

1. **Optimized tsup configuration** - Consistent, fast builds across all
   packages with eliminated configuration conflicts
2. **Strategic documentation** - Clear understanding of current risks and future
   migration path documented
3. **ADHD metrics achievement** - Build times meeting <2s target with clear
   visual feedback and single mental model preserved
