## Test Coverage

### Unit Tests

**Build Configuration Validation**

- Validate tsup configuration consistency across packages
- Test createPackageConfig output against expected Options interface
- Verify external dependencies are properly declared
- Validate entry/export alignment in package.json vs tsup config

**sideEffects Audit Tests**

- Test that all package entry points have no side effects
- Validate tree-shaking behavior with aggressive bundler settings
- Test import patterns don't trigger unintended global mutations

### Integration Tests

**Build System End-to-End**

- Test full monorepo build with timing measurements
- Validate build outputs match expected dist/ structure
- Test Turborepo cache behavior and hit rates
- Verify platform targeting produces correct bundle formats

**Package Consumption**

- Test that packages can be imported in both ESM and CJS contexts
- Validate export subpaths resolve correctly
- Test tree-shaking eliminates unused exports

### Performance Tests

**ADHD Flow State Metrics**

- Measure warm build times across all packages (<2s target)
- Test build error clarity and actionability
- Validate consistent error messaging patterns
- Measure context recovery time after build failures

### Mocking Requirements

- **File System**: Mock package.json reading for entry/export validation tests
- **Turborepo**: Mock turbo command execution for cache testing
- **Build Timing**: Mock performance.now() for consistent timing tests
