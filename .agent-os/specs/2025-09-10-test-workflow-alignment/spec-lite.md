# Spec Summary (Lite)

Align the existing test suite with the implemented ADHD-optimized CI workflow by
updating tests to match the actual 8-job structure with emoji indicators,
timeout limits, and two-tier testing. Tests currently expect complex features
that don't exist, causing false failures. This alignment ensures tests
accurately validate and document the streamlined CI system while preserving ADHD
optimization features.
