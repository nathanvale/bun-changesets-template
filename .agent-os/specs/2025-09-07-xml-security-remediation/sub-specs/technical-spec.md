# Technical Specification

This is the technical specification for the spec detailed in
@.agent-os/specs/2025-09-07-xml-security-remediation/spec.md

## Technical Requirements

### Priority 1: Critical Security Fixes (Week 1)

#### Command Injection Prevention

- Implement input sanitization for all template variables ({{BRANCH_NAME}},
  {{SPEC_PATH}}, {{FILE_PATH}}, etc.)
- Create validation schemas with regex patterns for each variable type
- Replace string interpolation with parameterized command execution
- Add shell escape functions for all Bash tool invocations
- Implement allowlist validation for Git branch names and file paths

#### Prompt Injection Protection

- Remove all "IMMEDIATE EXECUTION" and "BYPASS" directives
- Implement mandatory validation gates before tool execution
- Add user confirmation requirements for sensitive operations
- Create execution audit logging for all tool invocations
- Implement rate limiting for tool execution

#### Path Traversal Prevention

- Implement path canonicalization for all file operations
- Create allowlist of permitted directory paths
- Validate all file paths against traversal patterns (../, ..\, etc.)
- Add boundary checks for file operations
- Implement file access logging

### Priority 2: Structural Fixes (Week 1-2)

#### XML Syntax Corrections

- Fix unescaped characters in phase2-execution.xml line 39
- Wrap comparison operators in CDATA sections
- Validate all XML files against W3C standards
- Implement XML schema validation (XSD)

#### Token Optimization (25% reduction target)

- Extract common enforcement rules to shared component (~850 tokens saved)
- Flatten deep nesting structures (~600 tokens saved)
- Standardize metadata format (~400 tokens saved)
- Optimize response templates (~300 tokens saved)
- Convert verbose elements to concise attributes where appropriate

#### Dependency Resolution

- Map and document all import dependencies
- Eliminate circular dependencies between files
- Create linear dependency hierarchy
- Implement lazy loading for optional components

### Priority 3: Semantic Improvements (Week 2)

#### Execution Model Clarification

- Define single, consistent execution strategy (direct tools vs subagents)
- Remove contradictory directives
- Create clear execution flow documentation
- Implement execution mode configuration

#### Variable Registry Implementation

- Create comprehensive variable registry with:
  - Variable name and type definitions
  - Source identification (user input, system, derived)
  - Validation rules and patterns
  - Default values and required flags
- Implement variable validation before template rendering
- Add type checking for all variables

#### Error Handling Framework

- Add timeout specifications for all operations (default: 30s)
- Implement rollback procedures for failed operations
- Add retry logic with exponential backoff
- Create error recovery strategies for:
  - Network failures
  - File permission errors
  - Git operation failures
  - Test execution failures
  - Concurrent modification conflicts

### Performance Criteria

- Security audit score: ≥40/50 (from 8/50)
- Structural complexity: ≤50/100 (from 72/100)
- Token count: ≤6,400 (from 8,500)
- XML parsing: 100% success rate
- AI interpretation: ≥85% success rate (from 38%)
- Error recovery: ≥95% successful recovery
- Execution latency: ≤100ms overhead for validation

### Testing Requirements

- Unit tests for all validation functions
- Integration tests for security controls
- XML schema validation tests
- Token counting verification
- Performance benchmarks
- Security penetration testing
- Error injection testing

### Monitoring and Logging

- Implement structured logging for all operations
- Add metrics collection for:
  - Validation failures
  - Execution attempts
  - Error rates
  - Performance metrics
- Create audit trail for security-sensitive operations
- Implement alerting for security violations
