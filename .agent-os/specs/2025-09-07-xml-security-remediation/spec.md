> Spec: XML Security and Quality Remediation
> Created: 2025-09-07

## Overview

Implement comprehensive security remediation and structural optimization for the Agent OS XML instruction system to address critical vulnerabilities including command injection, prompt injection, and XML parsing errors. This initiative will transform the current unsafe system (18/100 score) into a production-ready, secure architecture (target 75/100 score) by implementing input validation, removing bypass mechanisms, and optimizing token efficiency.

## User Stories

### Security Administrator Story

As a security administrator, I want to ensure the Agent OS system cannot execute arbitrary commands from user input, so that the system is protected from injection attacks and unauthorized access.

The administrator needs to review all template variable usage, implement sanitization at every input point, and have confidence that no malicious input can bypass security controls. This includes preventing command injection through Git operations, path traversal through file operations, and prompt injection through immediate execution triggers.

### Developer Story  

As a developer using Agent OS, I want clear, consistent XML instructions without contradictions, so that I can understand and maintain the system effectively.

Developers currently face confusion from contradictory directives (e.g., "NO SUBAGENTS" while importing subagent protocols), undefined variables causing runtime failures, and excessive verbosity making the system hard to comprehend. They need a streamlined, coherent instruction set with proper examples and error handling.

### AI Assistant Story

As an AI assistant processing Agent OS instructions, I want well-formed XML with efficient token usage, so that I can execute tasks reliably without parsing errors or ambiguity.

The AI needs to process instructions without encountering XML syntax errors, understand variable scope and validation requirements, and have clear execution paths without contradictory commands. The current 62% interpretation failure rate must be reduced to under 10%.

## Spec Scope

1. **Security Hardening** - Implement input validation, sanitization, and remove all bypass mechanisms across all 11 XML instruction files
2. **XML Structure Fixes** - Repair syntax errors, resolve circular dependencies, and standardize element/attribute usage
3. **Token Optimization** - Reduce token usage by 25% through deduplication and structural improvements
4. **Semantic Clarity** - Resolve execution model contradictions and define variable registries with validation
5. **Error Handling Framework** - Add comprehensive error handling, timeouts, and rollback procedures

## Out of Scope

- Complete rewrite of the Agent OS architecture
- Migration to a different markup language (must remain XML)
- Integration with external security scanning tools
- Performance optimization beyond token reduction
- UI/dashboard for monitoring execution

## Expected Deliverable

1. All 11 XML files pass security audit with no critical vulnerabilities and security score above 40/50
2. XML parser successfully processes all files without syntax errors and achieves 25% token reduction
3. AI interpretation success rate increases from 38% to 85% with clear, non-contradictory instructions
