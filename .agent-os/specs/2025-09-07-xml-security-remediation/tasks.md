# Spec Tasks

## Tasks

- [ ] 1. Fix Critical Security Vulnerabilities
  - [ ] 1.1 Fix XML syntax error in phase2-execution.xml (unescaped < character)
  - [ ] 1.2 Remove all IMMEDIATE/BYPASS directives from execution-engine.xml and execute-tasks.xml
  - [ ] 1.3 Implement input sanitization for template variables (BRANCH_NAME, FILE_PATH, SPEC_PATH)
  - [ ] 1.4 Add mandatory user confirmation gates for tool execution
  - [ ] 1.5 Implement path validation and canonicalization to prevent traversal attacks
  - [ ] 1.6 Replace string interpolation with parameterized command execution
  - [ ] 1.7 Verify all security fixes work correctly

- [ ] 2. Create Shared Components and Variable Registry
  - [ ] 2.1 Create common-enforcement.xml with shared execution rules
  - [ ] 2.2 Create variable-registry.xml with type definitions and validation patterns
  - [ ] 2.3 Create security-controls.xml with access control configurations
  - [ ] 2.4 Update all 11 XML files to import shared components instead of duplicating rules
  - [ ] 2.5 Remove redundant enforcement blocks from individual files (~850 token savings)
  - [ ] 2.6 Verify all shared components work correctly

- [ ] 3. Optimize XML Structure and Token Usage
  - [ ] 3.1 Flatten deep nesting structures in tool-mapping.xml and phase files
  - [ ] 3.2 Standardize metadata format across all files (use attributes vs elements)
  - [ ] 3.3 Optimize response templates to use structured XML instead of verbose CDATA
  - [ ] 3.4 Convert appropriate elements to attributes for simple values
  - [ ] 3.5 Resolve circular dependencies between execute-tasks.xml, execution-engine.xml, and tool-mapping.xml
  - [ ] 3.6 Validate 25% token reduction target achieved (from ~8,500 to ~6,350 tokens)
  - [ ] 3.7 Verify all structural improvements work correctly

- [ ] 4. Resolve Semantic Contradictions and Add Error Handling
  - [ ] 4.1 Resolve subagent vs direct-tool execution model contradiction
  - [ ] 4.2 Define consistent variable scope and validation throughout system
  - [ ] 4.3 Add comprehensive error handling with timeout specifications (30s default)
  - [ ] 4.4 Implement rollback procedures for failed git operations and file changes
  - [ ] 4.5 Add error recovery strategies for network failures and permission errors
  - [ ] 4.6 Create concrete examples for all major workflows and variable usage
  - [ ] 4.7 Verify all semantic improvements and error handling work correctly

- [ ] 5. Implement Security Audit Logging and Final Validation
  - [ ] 5.1 Add execution audit logging for all tool invocations
  - [ ] 5.2 Implement file access logging with permission tracking
  - [ ] 5.3 Create security test suite with injection attack scenarios
  - [ ] 5.4 Run comprehensive security audit to verify score improvement (target: 40+/50)
  - [ ] 5.5 Validate AI interpretation success rate improvement (target: 85% from 38%)
  - [ ] 5.6 Document all security changes and create usage guidelines
  - [ ] 5.7 Verify all audit logging and final validation requirements are met
