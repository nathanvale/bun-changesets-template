# Spec Summary (Lite)

Add Markdown (.md) file support to the quality-check package's Prettier
integration, enabling automatic formatting of Markdown files through all entry
points (CLI, git hooks, API, Claude hook). This enhancement ensures consistent
Markdown formatting across documentation, specs, and README files without manual
intervention, treating Markdown formatting issues as auto-fixable just like
JavaScript and TypeScript files.
