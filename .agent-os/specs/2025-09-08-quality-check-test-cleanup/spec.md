# Spec Requirements Document

> Spec: Quality Check Test Cleanup Created: 2025-09-08

## Overview

Remove obsolete debug and test files from the quality-check package root
directory to maintain a clean, professional codebase. This cleanup will
eliminate confusion about which tests are part of the formal test suite and
reduce technical debt.

## User Stories

### Clean Package Structure

As a developer, I want to see only production code and formal tests in the
package directory, so that I can quickly understand the codebase structure
without being confused by debug artifacts.

When navigating the quality-check package, developers should encounter only the
essential directories (src/, tests/, bin/, dist/) and configuration files,
without scattered debug scripts that served temporary development purposes but
are now redundant.

## Spec Scope

1. **Delete Debug Scripts** - Remove all shell scripts used for manual testing
   during development
2. **Delete Test Artifacts** - Remove standalone test files that are not part of
   the formal test suite
3. **Verify No Dependencies** - Ensure no code references these files before
   deletion
4. **Update .gitignore** - Add patterns to prevent similar files from being
   committed in the future
5. **Clean Root Directory** - Remove related test files from the repository root

## Out of Scope

- Modifying the formal test suite in src/ and tests/ directories
- Changing the bin/ directory executables
- Refactoring existing test infrastructure
- Creating new testing utilities or scripts

## Expected Deliverable

1. A clean quality-check package directory containing only production code,
   formal tests, and necessary configuration
2. Updated .gitignore preventing future accumulation of debug scripts
3. Verification that all functionality tested by debug scripts is covered by the
   formal test suite
