> Spec: Test Infrastructure Cleanup and Migration Created: 2025-09-07

## Overview

Fix the test infrastructure issues where integration tests create persistent
temporary directories in the project root instead of using the OS temp
directory. This will prevent repository pollution, improve test isolation, and
ensure proper cleanup after test execution.

## User Stories

### Test Developer Story

As a test developer, I want temporary test directories to be automatically
cleaned up after tests run, so that my project root remains clean and I don't
have to manually delete test artifacts.

When running integration tests, the system should create isolated temporary
directories in the OS temp folder, execute tests within those directories, and
completely clean them up after test completion - whether tests pass or fail.
This ensures no test artifacts persist in the project root.

### CI/CD Pipeline Story

As a CI/CD pipeline maintainer, I want test execution to be completely isolated
and leave no artifacts, so that builds are reproducible and don't accumulate
test debris over time.

The test infrastructure should use unique directory names to prevent conflicts
in parallel test execution, properly handle cleanup even when tests fail or
timeout, and ensure no test artifacts can accidentally be committed to version
control.

## Spec Scope

1. **Test Directory Migration** - Migrate all test temporary directory creation
   from project root to OS temp directory
2. **Cleanup Mechanism Enhancement** - Implement robust cleanup with proper
   error handling and force removal options
3. **Gitignore Protection** - Add test-temp patterns to .gitignore to prevent
   accidental commits
4. **Test Isolation Refactor** - Refactor integration tests to use the existing
   test-isolation utility
5. **Parallel Test Safety** - Ensure unique directory naming to prevent
   conflicts in parallel execution

## Out of Scope

- Refactoring the entire test suite architecture
- Changing the test framework (Vitest remains)
- Modifying non-integration test files
- Creating new test utilities beyond fixing the current issue

## Expected Deliverable

1. All integration tests create temporary directories in OS temp folder, not
   project root
2. Complete cleanup of test directories after each test run, verified by file
   system checks
3. No test-temp directories persist in project root after test execution
