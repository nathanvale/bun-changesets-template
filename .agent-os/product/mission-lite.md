# AEPLS Mission (Lite)

AEPLS is a pragmatic quality enforcement system that ships in one week, not
months, by using a simple facade pattern that provides 80%+ automation through a
thin Claude hook wrapper (~50 lines) calling into a refactored quality-check
package (~440 lines), following YAGNI principles to add complexity only when
proven necessary.

AEPLS serves development teams and AI coding assistants who need consistent code
quality enforcement without manual effort. Unlike over-engineered solutions that
take months to implement, AEPLS uses a simple facade pattern with multiple entry
points (CLI, hooks, API) that delivers working software in one week with 80%+
automation of common issues, providing immediate value with a natural growth
path for future needs.
