## 2025-08-31: Build System Optimization Strategy

**ID:** DEC-001 **Status:** Accepted  
**Category:** Technical **Related Spec:**
@.agent-os/specs/2025-08-31-build-system-optimization/ **Stakeholders:** Product
Owner, Tech Lead, Team

### Decision

Optimize and standardize the current tsup + TypeScript + Turborepo build system
to eliminate critical maintenance risks and configuration inconsistencies while
maintaining ADHD-optimized developer experience with sub-5s feedback loops.

### Context

The build system has P0 strategic risks including dependency on unmaintained
tsup tooling, configuration conflicts between base and factory patterns, and
performance bottlenecks that impact ADHD flow state. Breaking changes are
acceptable to achieve standardization.

### Alternatives Considered

1. **Incremental Configuration Cleanup**
   - Pros: Low risk, maintains current functionality, quick implementation
   - Cons: Doesn't address strategic tsup dependency risk, only fixes symptoms

2. **Comprehensive Build System Audit + Optimization (Selected)**
   - Pros: Addresses both immediate P0/P1 issues and sets foundation for future
     migration
   - Cons: More complex, requires careful validation of sideEffects
   - **Rationale:** Aligns with ADHD-optimized developer experience goals by
     eliminating configuration complexity while addressing strategic risks

3. **Immediate Migration to tsdown/rolldown**
   - Pros: Eliminates strategic dependency risk immediately
   - Cons: High risk, significant scope creep, breaks focus on optimization

### Rationale

The comprehensive optimization approach allows us to:

- Address critical P0 strategic risks (unmaintained tsup dependency)
- Eliminate P1 configuration inconsistencies causing cognitive load
- Implement P2 build quality improvements for better debuggability
- Maintain <2s build times for ADHD flow state protection
- Document migration path for future strategic decisions

### Consequences

**Positive:**

- Unified build configuration reducing cognitive load
- <2s build times maintaining ADHD flow state
- Strategic risk documentation enabling informed future decisions
- Improved debuggability through library minification removal
- Foundation for future tsdown/rolldown migration

**Negative:**

- Breaking changes require team coordination
- Comprehensive sideEffects audit needed for tree-shaking safety
- Temporary complexity during transition period
