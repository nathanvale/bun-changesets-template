## 2025-01-17: Initial Product Planning

**ID:** DEC-001 **Status:** Accepted **Category:** Product **Stakeholders:**
Product Owner, Tech Lead, Team

### Decision

Create a comprehensive Bun + Changesets template focused on ADHD-optimized
developer experience, enterprise-grade security, and sub-50ms feedback loops.
Target individual developers, small teams, and enterprise adoption with complete
production-readiness from day one.

### Context

Existing development templates suffer from slow feedback loops, incomplete
configurations, security gaps, and poor scalability paths. Developers with ADHD
or focus challenges are particularly affected by delays over 100ms. The market
lacks a truly comprehensive, enterprise-ready template built on modern runtime
technology (Bun) that addresses these systematic issues.

### Alternatives Considered

1. **Generic Node.js Template**
   - Pros: Familiar ecosystem, wide adoption, extensive tooling
   - Cons: Slow performance, configuration overhead, security gaps

2. **Framework-Specific Templates (Create React App, Vue CLI)**
   - Pros: Framework integration, community support
   - Cons: Limited to single framework, outdated tooling, not enterprise-ready

3. **Minimalist Template**
   - Pros: Simple to understand, fast initial setup
   - Cons: Lacks production features, requires significant configuration

### Rationale

The Bun runtime provides 3-5x performance improvements over Node.js with native
TypeScript support and modern tooling. The comprehensive approach addresses the
full development lifecycle from initial setup through enterprise deployment.
ADHD-optimization specifically targets underserved developer needs with fast
feedback loops and reduced cognitive load.

### Consequences

**Positive:**

- Fastest development experience available (sub-50ms feedback)
- Immediate enterprise adoption capability
- Complete security and compliance features
- Scalable architecture from single package to monorepo
- Differentiated positioning in template market

**Negative:**

- Higher initial complexity than minimalist templates
- Dependency on relatively new Bun runtime
- Requires maintaining comprehensive configuration files
- May be overwhelming for absolute beginners

## 2025-01-17: Bun-First Architecture

**ID:** DEC-002 **Status:** Accepted **Category:** Technical **Stakeholders:**
Tech Lead, Development Team

### Decision

Build the template exclusively on Bun runtime instead of Node.js, using Bun's
native bundler, test runner, and package manager rather than external tools like
Webpack, Jest, or npm.

### Context

Bun provides significant performance advantages with native TypeScript support,
faster package installation, and integrated tooling. However, it's a relatively
new runtime with smaller ecosystem compared to Node.js.

### Alternatives Considered

1. **Node.js + Webpack/Vite**
   - Pros: Mature ecosystem, wide compatibility, extensive plugins
   - Cons: Slower performance, complex configuration, multiple tools to manage

2. **Hybrid Approach (Bun for dev, Node.js for production)**
   - Pros: Development speed benefits with production stability
   - Cons: Complexity of maintaining two runtimes, potential compatibility
     issues

### Rationale

The performance benefits of Bun align directly with the ADHD-optimization goal
of fast feedback loops. Native TypeScript support reduces tooling complexity.
The ecosystem is mature enough for template use cases, and the performance
advantages outweigh compatibility concerns.

### Consequences

**Positive:**

- 3-5x faster build and test times
- Simplified toolchain with fewer dependencies
- Native TypeScript and ES modules support
- Better memory efficiency

**Negative:**

- Smaller ecosystem compared to Node.js
- Potential compatibility issues with some packages
- Learning curve for developers unfamiliar with Bun

## 2025-01-17: Enterprise-First Security Model

**ID:** DEC-003 **Status:** Accepted **Category:** Security **Stakeholders:**
Security Team, Compliance, Tech Lead

### Decision

Implement enterprise-grade security features including npm provenance, SBOM
generation, vulnerability scanning, and supply chain protection as core template
features rather than optional add-ons.

### Context

Many templates treat security as an afterthought, making them unsuitable for
enterprise adoption. Supply chain attacks and dependency vulnerabilities are
increasing concerns for organizations.

### Alternatives Considered

1. **Basic Security (ESLint security plugin only)**
   - Pros: Simple, low maintenance overhead
   - Cons: Insufficient for enterprise use, manual security processes

2. **Optional Security Add-ons**
   - Pros: Flexibility, easier initial setup
   - Cons: Often skipped by developers, inconsistent security posture

### Rationale

Security should be built-in by default rather than bolted on later. Enterprise
adoption requires comprehensive security from day one. The overhead of
maintaining security features is justified by the value provided to professional
users.

### Consequences

**Positive:**

- Immediate enterprise adoption capability
- Comprehensive supply chain protection
- Audit trail and compliance documentation
- Professional credibility and trust

**Negative:**

- Increased template complexity
- Dependency on external security services
- Potential CI/CD slowdown from security scanning
- Higher maintenance overhead for security updates
