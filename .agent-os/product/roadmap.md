## Risk Register

| Risk                     | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation                              |
| ------------------------ | ------ | ---------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Bun/Vitest compatibility | High   | Medium     | Single-threaded mode, fallback patterns |
| Complex mental model     | Medium | Low        | Keep to 3 simple packages, clear docs   |
| Turborepo config issues  | Medium | Low        | Fix $TURBO_ROOT$, follow best practices |
| Cross-package imports    | Low    | Low        | Proper exports configuration            |
| Performance regression   | Low    | Low        | Continuous monitoring, benchmarks       |

## Notes

- **Monorepo-First Philosophy:** Start as monorepo, stay as monorepo - no
  migration complexity
- **ADHD Optimization:** Every decision prioritizes <50ms feedback and cognitive
  simplicity
- **Package Focus:** Three packages only - utils (shared), app (testing), server
  (API)
- **Coverage Requirements:** No grace period - new packages must meet thresholds
  **immediately**
