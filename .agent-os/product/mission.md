# Product Mission

> Last Updated: 2025-01-17 Version: 1.0.0

## Pitch

Bun Changesets Template is a production-grade, enterprise-ready development
template that helps developers create high-performance TypeScript projects by
providing a comprehensive, ADHD-optimized development environment with sub-50ms
feedback loops and enterprise-grade security.

## Users

### Primary Customers

- **Individual Developers**: Solo developers who want a comprehensive,
  batteries-included development setup
- **Small Teams**: Development teams of 2-10 people who need consistent tooling
  and workflows
- **Enterprise Organizations**: Large companies requiring security, compliance,
  and scalability features
- **Open Source Maintainers**: Project maintainers who want professional-grade
  tooling for their repositories

### User Personas

**Solo Developer** (25-40 years old)

- **Role:** Full-stack Developer / Freelancer
- **Context:** Working on personal projects or client work, often with ADHD or
  focus challenges
- **Pain Points:** Configuration fatigue, slow feedback loops, inconsistent
  tooling setups
- **Goals:** Fast development cycles, minimal configuration overhead,
  professional-quality output

**Tech Lead** (30-45 years old)

- **Role:** Senior Developer / Team Lead
- **Context:** Managing development standards across a team, ensuring code
  quality and consistency
- **Pain Points:** Inconsistent development environments, security
  vulnerabilities, slow CI/CD pipelines
- **Goals:** Standardized tooling, automated quality gates, scalable
  architecture patterns

**Enterprise Architect** (35-50 years old)

- **Role:** Principal Engineer / Architecture Lead
- **Context:** Defining technology standards for large organizations with
  compliance requirements
- **Pain Points:** Supply chain security, regulatory compliance, performance at
  scale
- **Goals:** Enterprise-grade security, comprehensive documentation, audit
  trails

## The Problem

### Slow Development Feedback Loops

Traditional Node.js development environments suffer from slow startup times,
inefficient build processes, and delayed feedback cycles that particularly
impact developers with ADHD or focus challenges. Studies show that feedback
delays over 100ms significantly reduce developer productivity and satisfaction.

**Our Solution:** Sub-50ms hot reload and comprehensive ADHD-optimized tooling
with instant feedback.

### Configuration Hell and Template Fragmentation

Developers spend 20-40% of project setup time configuring ESLint, Prettier,
TypeScript, testing frameworks, and CI/CD pipelines, often with incomplete or
outdated configurations that introduce security vulnerabilities.

**Our Solution:** Complete, production-ready configuration files that work
together seamlessly from day one.

### Security and Compliance Gaps

Most development templates lack enterprise-grade security features like supply
chain protection, vulnerability scanning, and compliance documentation, making
them unsuitable for professional and enterprise use.

**Our Solution:** Built-in security scanning, npm provenance, SBOM generation,
and comprehensive compliance documentation.

### Poor Monorepo Evolution Path

Starting with single-package templates that can't easily evolve into monorepos
creates technical debt and forces complete rewrites as projects grow.

**Our Solution:** Architecture designed for seamless monorepo evolution with
workspace support and build orchestration ready from the start.

## Differentiators

### ADHD-Optimized Development Experience

Unlike generic templates that prioritize features over developer experience, we
provide sub-50ms feedback loops, clear visual indicators, and simplified mental
models. This results in 50% faster development cycles and reduced cognitive
load.

### Complete Enterprise Readiness

Unlike hobbyist templates, we provide production-grade security scanning, supply
chain protection, compliance documentation, and audit trails out-of-the-box.
This results in immediate enterprise adoption capability without additional
security work.

### Bun-First Performance Architecture

Unlike Node.js-based templates that retrofit performance, we're built from the
ground up on Bun's high-performance runtime. This results in 3-5x faster build
times and 50% lower memory usage compared to equivalent Node.js setups.
