# Product Mission

> Last Updated: 2025-01-27 Version: 1.1.0

## Pitch

Production-grade Bun + TypeScript template that evolves from single package to
Turborepo monorepo in one command—optimized for ADHD-grade feedback and
enterprise security.

## Users

### Primary Customers

- **Individual Developers**: Solo developers who want a comprehensive,
  batteries-included development setup
- **Small Teams**: Development teams of 2-10 people who need consistent tooling
  and workflows
- **Enterprise Organizations**: Large companies requiring security, compliance,
  and scalability features
- **Open Source Maintainers**: Project maintainers who want professional-grade
  tooling for their repositories

### User Personas

**Solo Developer** (25-40 years old)

- **Role:** Full-stack Developer / Freelancer
- **Context:** Working on personal projects or client work, often with ADHD or
  focus challenges
- **Pain Points:** Configuration fatigue, slow feedback loops, inconsistent
  tooling setups
- **Goals:** Fast development cycles, minimal configuration overhead,
  professional-quality output

**Tech Lead** (30-45 years old)

- **Role:** Senior Developer / Team Lead
- **Context:** Managing development standards across a team, ensuring code
  quality and consistency
- **Pain Points:** Inconsistent development environments, security
  vulnerabilities, slow CI/CD pipelines
- **Goals:** Standardized tooling, automated quality gates, scalable
  architecture patterns

**Enterprise Architect** (35-50 years old)

- **Role:** Principal Engineer / Architecture Lead
- **Context:** Defining technology standards for large organizations with
  compliance requirements
- **Pain Points:** Supply chain security, regulatory compliance, performance at
  scale
- **Goals:** Enterprise-grade security, comprehensive documentation, audit
  trails

## The Problem

### Slow Development Feedback Loops

Traditional Node.js development environments suffer from slow startup times,
inefficient build processes, and delayed feedback cycles that particularly
impact developers with ADHD or focus challenges. Studies show that feedback
delays over 100ms significantly reduce developer productivity and satisfaction.

**Our Solution:** Sub-50ms hot reload and comprehensive ADHD-optimized tooling
with instant feedback.

### Configuration Hell and Template Fragmentation

Developers spend 20-40% of project setup time configuring ESLint, Prettier,
TypeScript, testing frameworks, and CI/CD pipelines, often with incomplete or
outdated configurations that introduce security vulnerabilities.

**Our Solution:** Complete, production-ready configuration files that work
together seamlessly from day one.

### Security and Compliance Gaps

Most development templates lack enterprise-grade security features like supply
chain protection, vulnerability scanning, and compliance documentation, making
them unsuitable for professional and enterprise use.

**Our Solution:** Built-in security scanning, npm provenance, SBOM generation,
and comprehensive compliance documentation.

### Poor Monorepo Evolution Path

Starting with single-package templates that can't easily evolve into monorepos
creates technical debt and forces complete rewrites as projects grow. Typical
manual restructuring costs 0.5–1.5 engineer days (config merge, CI fixes,
dependency scopes).

**Our Solution:** One-command monorepo promotion with `bun run promote:monorepo`
script that seamlessly transforms single packages into Turborepo + Bun +
Changesets workspaces following "opt-in complexity only when you need >1
package" philosophy. See Roadmap Phase 1.

## Differentiators

### ADHD-Optimized Development Experience

Unlike generic templates that prioritize features over developer experience, we
provide sub-50ms feedback loops, clear visual indicators, and simplified mental
models. This results in 50% faster development cycles and reduced cognitive
load.

### Complete Enterprise Readiness

Unlike hobbyist templates, we provide production-grade security scanning, supply
chain protection, compliance documentation, and audit trails out-of-the-box.
This results in immediate enterprise adoption capability without additional
security work.

### Seamless Monorepo Promotion

Unlike traditional templates that trap you in single-package architectures, we
provide automated monorepo transformation through our `bun run promote:monorepo`
script. This results in structural promotion without replatforming from simple
projects to complex workspaces with Turborepo orchestration, preserving all
existing tooling and configurations.

### Bun-First Performance Architecture

Unlike Node.js-based templates that retrofit performance, we're built from the
ground up on Bun's high-performance runtime. This results in 3-5x faster build
times and 50% lower memory usage compared to equivalent Node.js setups.

## Key Features

  consistent naming
- **Advanced Debugging Support:** Built-in profiling, memory analysis, and
  performance monitoring
- **VSCode Integration:** Complete workspace configuration with recommended
  extensions and settings
- **Git Workflow Automation:** Automated commit linting, branch protection, and
  merge validation

### Enterprise Features

- **Supply Chain Security:** npm provenance, SBOM generation, and vulnerability
  scanning

## Non-Goals

- **Not a full-stack framework:** We provide the foundation but don't dictate UI
  frameworks, databases, or backend architectures
- **Not an opinionated deployment platform:** We support all major deployment
  targets but don't lock you into specific hosting providers
- **Not enforcing fixed versioning:** While we include Changesets, teams can
  adopt any versioning strategy that fits their workflow
