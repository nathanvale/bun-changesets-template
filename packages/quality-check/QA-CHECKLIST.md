# Quality Assurance Checklist - Task 10 Final Integration Testing

## Critical Issues Found & Fixed

- [x] **CRITICAL**: Missing `bin` field in package.json - FIXED
- [x] **CRITICAL**: Index.js not executable - FIXED

## QA Test Categories

### 1. NPX Execution Testing

- [ ] Test `npx` execution with help flag
- [ ] Test `npx` execution with file mode
- [ ] Test `npx` execution with hook mode (stdin)
- [ ] Verify executable permissions are correct

### 2. Exit Code Validation

- [ ] Test exit code 0 (success)
- [ ] Test exit code 1 (general error)
- [ ] Test exit code 2 (ESLint errors only)
- [ ] Test exit code 3 (Prettier errors only)
- [ ] Test exit code 4 (TypeScript errors only)
- [ ] Test exit code 5 (multiple checker errors)
- [ ] Test exit code 124 (timeout)

### 3. Performance Requirements

- [ ] Verify <2s performance requirement met
- [ ] Test performance with real-world files
- [ ] Measure parallel vs sequential execution

### 4. Claude Code Integration

- [ ] Test PostToolUse hook integration
- [ ] Test stdin JSON parsing
- [ ] Test correlation ID handling
- [ ] Verify hook mode auto-detection

### 5. Package Distribution Readiness

- [ ] Verify package.json configuration
- [ ] Test build output completeness
- [ ] Validate export maps
- [ ] Check file inclusions for NPM
- [ ] Test dependency resolution

### 6. End-to-End Scenarios

- [ ] Complete workflow test: npx -> file check -> results
- [ ] Error handling robustness
- [ ] Cross-platform compatibility
- [ ] Node.js version compatibility

## Test Results Log

### CRITICAL ISSUES DISCOVERED:

- [!] **NPX execution not working** - no output from npx commands
- [!] **Exit codes incorrect** - getting exit code 3 instead of 0 for valid files  
- [!] **Hook mode failing** - path traversal security check too restrictive
- [!] **ESLint configuration issues** - files outside base path warnings
- [!] **execSync not capturing output correctly** - may need different approach

### Performance Tests PASSED âœ…
- [x] <2s requirement met (774ms)
- [x] Parallel vs sequential both under reasonable time

### Issues to Fix:
1. Fix NPX execution and output capture
2. Debug exit code logic
3. Adjust hook mode security checks for temp files
4. Fix ESLint base path configuration
5. Improve test execution methodology
