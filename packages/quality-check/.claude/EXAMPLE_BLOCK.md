## 📋 Claude Code Instructions

This file indicates **Exit Code 2** - quality issues were found that need

problems are resolved.

**What Exit Code 2 means:**

- Quality issues (TypeScript, ESLint, Prettier) were detected
- These issues prevent the code from being production-ready
- Fix the issues below and retry the quality check
- This file will be automatically cleaned up once issues are resolved

## ⚠️ Issues Found

Found 2 issue(s) that need attention:

### 📄 `src/sample.ts`

**Line 10:5** - `TS2304` (typescript)

**Issue:** Cannot find name 'SomeType'

⚡ **Quick-fixable:** This has automated fix suggestions available

**💡 Why this matters:** TypeScript needs to know the type definition to provide
type safety

**🛠️ How to fix:** Import the missing type or define it locally

**🚀 Prevention tip:** Use proper imports and type definitions

**✅ Suggested code fix:**

```typescript
import type { SomeType } from './types.js'
```

**Line 15:3** - `@typescript-eslint/no-unused-vars` (eslint)

**Issue:** 'unusedVariable' is defined but never used

🔧 **Auto-fixable:** This can be automatically fixed by running the quality
check with `--fix` flag

**💡 Why this matters:** Unused variables add noise to the codebase and may
indicate dead code

**🛠️ How to fix:** Remove the unused variable or prefix with underscore to
indicate intentional
