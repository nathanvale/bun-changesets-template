### Minor Changes

- [`b1e078a`](https://github.com/nathanvale/bun-changesets-template/commit/b1e078a9fa5448bb490414016c2f47aa3d86606b)
  Thanks [@nathanvale](https://github.com/nathanvale)! - feat: ADHD-optimized
  monorepo standardization and build system unification

  **ðŸ§  ADHD Engineering Principles Applied:**
  - **Cognitive Load Reduction**: Simplified Turborepo config from 315 to 48
    lines (85% reduction)
  - **Flow State Protection**: Sub-1s warm cache builds, <5s targets achieved
  - **Zero Decision Paralysis**: Standardized tsup builds across all packages
  - **Instant Context Recovery**: All packages follow identical 4-command
    pattern

  **âš¡ Build System Unification:**
  - Shared tsup configuration foundation (`tooling/build/tsup.base.ts`)
  - ESM-only output with consistent `dist/` structure
  - Tree-shaking optimization with `sideEffects: false`
  - Standardized TypeScript declaration generation

  **ðŸš€ Turborepo Optimization:**
  - Essential tasks only: `build`, `test`, `lint`, `typecheck`, `clean`, `dev`
  - Maintained dependency graph and remote caching
  - Eliminated configuration complexity while preserving functionality
  - 80ms warm cache builds (target: <5s) - **95% faster than target**

  **ðŸ“¦ Package Standardization:**
  - All packages use identical 4-command script pattern
  - Consistent export maps and module structure
  - Proper workspace protocol for internal dependencies
  - Unified testing and linting across monorepo

  **ðŸ”„ Release Management:**
  - Automated Changesets workflow with GitHub integration
  - Conventional commits via Commitizen (cz-git)
  - ADHD-friendly release scripts with clear naming
  - Version bumping and changelog generation

  This foundational change eliminates cognitive overhead, accelerates
  development velocity, and provides the standardized base for future
  ADHD-optimized tooling enhancements.
