# Bun + Changesets + Commitizen Template

> A GitHub‚Äëready template that uses **Bun for everything** (dev, build, test),
> **Commitizen + Conventional Commits** for clean history, **Commitlint +
> Husky** for local enforcement, and **Changesets** for versioning and automated
> release PRs. Comes with **GitHub Actions** for CI & publishing with npm
> provenance.

## Why this template

- **Speed**: Bun makes installs, dev, and tests snappy.
- **Consistency**: Commitizen + Conventional Commits + Commitlint keep history
  clean.
- **Safety**: Husky prevents sloppy commits. CI checks enforce everything again.
- **Automation**: Changesets opens a **Version Packages** PR that bumps
  versions, writes changelogs, and (optionally) publishes to npm with
  provenance.
- **Agnostic**: Works for **apps** (keep `private: true`) and for **libraries**
  (flip to `private: false` and add proper exports).

---

## Features

- **Bun‚Äënative** scripts for dev/build/test.
- **Husky** hooks: `pre-commit` (lint/format/typecheck) & `commit-msg`
  (commitlint).
- **Commitizen** (`git cz`) with **cz-git** prompts.
- **Changesets** with GitHub changelog plugin and a Release workflow.
- **CI** workflow that runs lint, typecheck, and tests on PRs and main.
- **Release** workflow that either opens/updates a **Version Packages** PR or
  publishes on merge.
- **Starter** `package.json` and `src/index.ts` (hello world server) included.
- **`setup.sh`** to replace placeholders and install toolchain in one go.

---

## Quick Start

```bash
# 1) Download this repo (or "Use this template" in GitHub)
# 2) Run setup (replaces placeholders like YOUR_GH_USER/YOUR_REPO; installs deps)
chmod +x setup.sh
./setup.sh

# 3) Sanity check
bun run dev   # starts hello-world server on :3000
bun run commit   # guided commit (Commitizen)
bun run release  # create a changeset
git push         # CI runs; Release workflow opens/updates Version Packages PR
```

If you want to convert this repo itself into a **GitHub Repository Template**
with the `gh` CLI, see: `.github/` actions already in place; then run:

```bash
# assuming you've created and pushed the repo
gh api --method PATCH "repos/<USER_OR_ORG>/<REPO_NAME>" -f is_template=true
```

---

## Scripts

```jsonc
{
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "bun --watch src/index.ts",
    "build": "bun build src/index.ts --outdir=dist --target=node --format=esm,cjs",
    "start": "bun dist/index.js",
    "test": "bun test",
    "lint": "eslint .",
    "lint:fix": "eslint . --fix",
    "lint:check": "eslint . --cache --max-warnings 0",
    "format": "prettier --write .",
    "format:check": "prettier --check .",
    "typecheck": "tsc --noEmit",
    "cz": "git-cz",
    "commit": "git-cz",
    "release": "bunx changeset",
    "release:version": "bunx changeset version",
    "release:publish": "bunx changeset publish",
  },
}
```

- Use **`bun run commit`** to open the Commitizen wizard.
- Use **`bun run release`** to create a changeset (choose patch/minor/major).

---

## GitHub Actions Workflows

### CI (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`)

- Triggers on PRs and pushes to `main`.
- Steps: checkout ‚Üí setup Bun ‚Üí install with `--frozen-lockfile` ‚Üí lint ‚Üí
  typecheck ‚Üí test.
- A second job runs **commitlint** against PR commits to cover squash merges and
  web UI edits that bypass Husky.

### Release (`.github/workflows/release.yml`)

- Triggers on push to `main`.
- Steps: checkout (full history) ‚Üí setup Bun ‚Üí install ‚Üí (optional build) ‚Üí run
  **changesets/action**.
- Behavior:
  - If there are **pending changesets**, opens/updates a **‚ÄúVersion Packages‚Äù**
    PR.
  - When that PR is **merged**, it versions & publishes (if `private: false` &
    `NPM_TOKEN` present).

---

## Release Flow (Changesets)

1. Developer runs `bun run release` and selects bumps (patch/minor/major). This
   creates `.changeset/*.md` files.
2. Push ‚Üí Release workflow finds pending changesets and opens/updates a
   **Version Packages** PR.
3. Merge that PR:
   - `changeset version` updates versions & changelogs.
   - `changeset publish` publishes to npm **if** `private: false` and
     `NPM_TOKEN` is configured (with npm provenance if `id-token: write` +
     `NPM_CONFIG_PROVENANCE=true`).

> The template uses the **`changeset`** binary provided by **`@changesets/cli`**
> (important).

---

## Commit Flow (Commitizen & Commitlint)

- Run `bun run commit` (or `git cz`) ‚Üí choose type, scope, subject; Commitizen
  writes a proper Conventional Commit.
- Husky‚Äôs `commit-msg` hook runs **commitlint** to enforce the rules locally.
- CI also runs commitlint on PRs to catch commits created via web UI or squash
  merges (they bypass local hooks).

---

## Best‚Äëpractice `.bunfig.toml`

A sensible default you can drop into the repo root:

```toml
[install]
frozenLockfile = true
exact = true
dedupe = true
saveTextLockfile = true  # commits a human-readable bun.lock alongside bun.lockb

[test]
coverage = true
clearConsole = true
isolate = true

[run]
envFile = ".env"

[experimental]
workspaces = true
```

**Why**: reproducible installs, fewer dupes, consistent test output, and `.env`
loading for `bun run` commands. Keep it minimal and team-friendly.

---

## Pros / Cons / Gotchas

### ‚úÖ Pros

- **One toolchain** (Bun) for dev/build/test ‚Üí less config drift, faster CI.
- **Commit hygiene** via Commitizen + commitlint ‚Üí clean history &
  auto‚Äëgenerated changelogs read better.
- **Automated release**: Changesets PR ‚Üí reviewable version bumps & changelog ‚Üí
  publish on merge.
- **Provenance** optional: add `id-token: write` + `NPM_CONFIG_PROVENANCE=true`
  to get the npm supply‚Äëchain badge.
- **Ready for monorepos**: Changesets works across packages; Bun can link
  workspaces.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Cons

- **Bun vs Node differences**: some Node‚ÄëAPM SDKs or native addons may need
  validation; for widely used libs you may add a small Node CI job to
  double‚Äëcheck.
- **Binary lockfile (`bun.lockb`)**: fast and compact, but less diffable (we
  also commit a text lock using `saveTextLockfile=true`).

### üß® Gotchas

- **Wrong CLI package**: The binary is `changeset` (singular) provided by
  `@changesets/cli`. Installing `changesets` (plural) causes ‚Äúcould not
  determine executable‚Äù failures.
- **Publishing blocked by `private: true`**: flip to `false` when you‚Äôre ready
  to publish.
- **Commit hooks aren‚Äôt absolute**: web UI commits and squash merges bypass
  local Husky; CI commitlint job is essential.
- **Exports for libraries**: if you publish a library, build **Node‚Äëtargeted**
  ESM/CJS and set proper `exports`/`types`. Bun‚Äëtarget output is for Bun
  runtimes only.

---

## Publishing to npm (with provenance)

1. In `package.json`: set `"private": false`, point `main/types/exports` to your
   built files in `dist/`.
2. Add **Actions secret**: `NPM_TOKEN` (publish rights for your scope).
3. In the Release workflow YAML, keep:
   ```yaml
   permissions:
     contents: write
     id-token: write
   env:
     NPM_CONFIG_PROVENANCE: 'true'
   ```
4. Merge the **Version Packages** PR ‚Üí publish runs automatically.

> For scoped packages, the **first publish** may require `--access public`. The
> template‚Äôs `publishConfig.access=public` takes care of this.

---

## Monorepo Notes

- Add `workspaces` to root `package.json`, e.g.:
  ```json
  {
    "workspaces": ["packages/*"]
  }
  ```
- Keep a single `.changeset/config.json` at the root; each changeset file can
  list multiple packages.
- CI can continue to run at the root (Changesets knows which packages changed).

---

## Troubleshooting

### ‚Äúerror: could not determine executable to run for package changeset‚Äù

- Cause: using `changesets` package instead of **`@changesets/cli`**.
- Fix:
  ```bash
  bun remove changesets || true
  bun add -d @changesets/cli @changesets/changelog-github
  ```

### Release workflow makes a branch `changeset-release/main` then fails

- Usually caused by the same CLI mismatch above or missing devDeps in CI. Ensure
  `bun install --frozen-lockfile` runs and `@changesets/cli` is present.

### Web UI commits bypass commit hooks

- This is expected. The CI job `commitlint` in `ci.yml` checks PR commit
  messages server-side.

### npm publish doesn‚Äôt happen

- Check: `private: false`, `NPM_TOKEN` is set, workflow has `id-token: write`,
  and the **Version Packages** PR was merged (not just closed).

### Native addons / APM SDKs

- If you use packages with native bindings (e.g., `sharp`, DB drivers), validate
  under Bun early. If needed, add a Node test matrix in CI to ensure consumer
  compatibility.

---

## Security & Supply Chain tips

- Run `bun install --frozen-lockfile` in CI to avoid accidental drift.
- Keep the commitlint job to enforce Conventional Commits end‚Äëto‚Äëend.
- Use npm provenance (`id-token: write` + `NPM_CONFIG_PROVENANCE=true`) for
  tamper‚Äëevident releases.
- Consider a periodic dependency check (`bun outdated`, `bun audit`) as a
  scheduled workflow.

## FAQ

**Q: Can I use this template for an app that will never be published?**  
A: Yes. Keep `"private": true`. You still get clean commits, release notes, and
CI.

**Q: How do I generate changelogs for GitHub releases?**  
A: The template uses `@changesets/changelog-github`, which writes entries into
`CHANGELOG.md` inside the repo when versions are bumped.

**Q: Do I need Node installed if I‚Äôm using Bun?**  
A: For most cases no, but if your code must be executed under Node by consumers
(libraries), add a Node job in CI to validate.

**Q: Can I add Playwright or Vitest instead of Bun test?**  
A: Yes. You can run `bun x vitest` or `bun x playwright test` alongside
`bun test` if specific features are needed.
