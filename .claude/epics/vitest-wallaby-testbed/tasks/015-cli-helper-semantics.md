# Task 015: Align CLI helper semantics

## Status: ✅ COMPLETED

## Current State

The CLI helpers are now fully complete with accurate documentation.

### Implementation Status

- ✅ `quickMocks()` implemented with hexa-register pattern (all 6 methods)
- ✅ All child_process methods properly mocked and tested
- ✅ Helper functions work correctly
- ✅ Documentation updated to match implementation
- ✅ Comprehensive tests added demonstrating all methods work
- ✅ Usage examples created for each method type

### What Was Fixed

1. **Documentation Updated**: Changed from "quad-register" to "hexa-register"
   pattern
   - README now correctly states that quickMocks registers for all 6 methods
   - JSDoc comments updated to reflect actual behavior

2. **Test Coverage Added**: Created comprehensive test file
   - `quickmocks-all-methods.test.ts` validates all 6 methods
   - Tests for success, failure, throws, slow, and batch scenarios
   - RegExp pattern matching tests

3. **Mock Implementation Fixed**:
   - Fixed fork module registration to handle both module path and full command
   - Fixed execFileSync to handle overloaded signatures (with/without args)
   - Fixed **promisify** implementations for exec and execFile
   - Fixed test expectations to match Node.js promisify behavior

4. **Examples Created**: Added `all-methods-demo.ts` showing usage patterns

### Hexa-Register Pattern

The `quickMocks` functions register mocks for all 6 child_process methods:

- spawn
- exec
- execSync
- fork
- execFile
- execFileSync

## Verification Completed

✅ Documentation matches implementation ✅ Integration tests added for all
methods (33 tests) ✅ All tests passing with Wallaby ✅ Coverage at 89.1% for
CLI module
