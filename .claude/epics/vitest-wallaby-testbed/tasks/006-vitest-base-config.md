# Task 006: Configure Vitest base settings

## Status: ✅ COMPLETED

## Implementation Summary

Vitest base configuration fully implemented with environment-aware optimizations.

### Core Implementation
- ✅ `src/config/vitest.base.ts` - Comprehensive base configuration
- ✅ Environment detection (CI, Wallaby, local)
- ✅ Fork-based pool strategy for stability

### Features Implemented
- **Pool strategy**: Fork-based for process isolation
- **Worker configuration**: Environment-aware caps
- **Wallaby optimizations**: Single worker, disabled coverage
- **CI optimizations**: JUnit reporter, worker limits
- **Coverage setup**: V8 provider with thresholds
- **Timeout configuration**: Scaled for environment
- **Reporter selection**: Verbose locally, JUnit in CI
- **Setup files**: Automatic testkit register inclusion

### Configuration Details
```typescript
- pool: 'forks' for stability
- isolate: true for test isolation
- CI worker cap: 2 for GitHub Actions
- Wallaby: Single worker, verbose output
- Coverage thresholds: 80% target
- Memory limits per worker
- Test timeout scaling
```

### Environment Support
- **Local development**: Fast feedback, verbose output
- **CI (GitHub Actions)**: JUnit reports, resource limits
- **Wallaby**: Optimized for instant feedback
- **Coverage mode**: Full instrumentation

## Verification
- Configuration loads correctly
- Environment detection accurate
- Fork pool provides isolation
- Coverage collection works
- Wallaby performance optimal
