# Task: Build SQLite transaction utilities for test isolation

## Description

Create transaction management utilities that enable test isolation through
commit/rollback using a generic adapter model. Keep driver-agnostic here;
provide nested/savepoint support later if needed.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Create `packages/testkit/src/sqlite/txn.ts` with transaction helpers
- [x] Implement `withTransaction` wrapper for commit/rollback
- [x] Define `TransactionAdapter<TDb, TTx>` interface
- [x] Enable transaction-per-test isolation pattern (docs/example)
- [x] Unit tests using a fake adapter
- [x] Anti-flake: document transaction-per-test as the default pattern; avoid
      concurrent DB tests in a single file

## Technical Details

- Implementation location: `packages/testkit/src/sqlite/txn.ts`
- Driver-agnostic; no direct DB calls here
- Keep API minimal: begin/commit/rollback via adapter
- Nested/savepoint support can be added later if needed

## Dependencies

- [ ] Memory database implementation (Task 001)
- [ ] File database implementation (Task 002)
- [ ] Database driver with transaction support

## Effort Estimate

- Size: M
- Hours: 3-4
- Parallel: false (depends on database implementations)

## Definition of Done

- [x] Transaction wrapper implemented with rollback
- [x] Unit tests cover commit and rollback behavior
- [x] Documentation includes transaction-per-test pattern

## Completion Notes

Completed on 2025-09-23:

### Implementation

- Enhanced existing `packages/testkit/src/sqlite/txn.ts` with comprehensive
  documentation
- Added detailed JSDoc comments for all exports
- Maintained driver-agnostic adapter interface
- Proper error handling with silent rollback on failures

### Testing with Wallaby TDD

- Used Wallaby MCP tools to verify 100% test coverage
- 14 comprehensive tests covering all scenarios:
  - Success path with commit
  - Error handling with rollback
  - Rollback failure graceful handling
  - Begin/commit failure scenarios
  - Transaction isolation patterns
  - Real-world SQLite adapter examples
- Runtime value verification confirmed proper execution paths
- Added integration tests demonstrating real usage patterns

### Documentation

- Module-level documentation with transaction-per-test pattern
- Anti-flake best practices documented
- Adapter implementation guide with examples
- JSDoc comments for all interfaces and functions
- Usage examples for real-world scenarios

### Validation

- All tests passing (14/14)
- Quality checks passed
- TypeScript compilation successful
- Import style fixed to use .js extensions
