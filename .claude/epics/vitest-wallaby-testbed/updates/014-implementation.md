# Task 014 Implementation Update

**Status**: ✅ COMPLETED
**Date**: 2025-09-21
**Time Spent**: ~2 hours
**Commit**: bd66204

## Summary
Successfully implemented the testkit bootstrap module that enforces proper import order for vi.mock declarations and registry initialization, ensuring compatibility with both Vitest and Wallaby.js test runners. This solves the critical import order issues that were causing test failures and incompatibility between different test environments.

## Changes Made

### 1. Bootstrap Module Enhancement (`packages/testkit/src/bootstrap.ts`)
- Already had core structure from Task 013
- Added environment detection for Vitest/Wallaby
- Implemented validation utilities to detect and warn about multiple loads
- Added cleanup hooks with afterEach for automatic mock registry clearing
- Export status utilities for debugging

### 2. Vitest Configuration Updates
- **Root config** (`vitest.config.ts`): Added setupFiles pointing to testkit's setup.ts
- **Package config** (`packages/testkit/vitest.config.ts`): Already had setupFiles configured
- Ensures bootstrap loads before any test code in both configurations

### 3. Test File Updates
- Removed duplicate `vi.mock()` declarations from test files:
  - `process-mock.test.ts`: Removed vi.mock and now relies on bootstrap
  - `mock.test.ts`: Removed vi.mock and deprecated setupChildProcessMocks call
  - `spawn.test.ts`: Already clean, no vi.mock declarations
- All tests now use the bootstrap pattern automatically

### 4. Mock Factory Improvements (`packages/testkit/src/cli/mock-factory.ts`)
- Fixed `execSync` to throw errors on non-zero exit codes (mimics real behavior)
- Fixed `exec` to create errors for non-zero exit codes
- Proper error object creation with code, cmd, stderr, stdout properties
- TypeScript-compliant error handling

### 5. MockChildProcess Fixes (`packages/testkit/src/cli/process-mock.ts`)
- Fixed signal handling: When terminated by signal, exitCode is null
- Fixed async execution: Using setImmediate to ensure events emit after listeners attach
- Fixed error emission: Only emit 'error' event if listeners exist to avoid unhandled rejections
- Proper exit/close event emission for all scenarios

### 6. Documentation
- Created comprehensive bootstrap pattern documentation (`packages/testkit/docs/bootstrap-pattern.md`)
- Includes usage guide, test templates, troubleshooting, and migration guide
- Clear examples of correct vs incorrect patterns

## Test Results

### Before Implementation
- 21 failing tests out of 127 total
- Import order issues causing mock initialization failures
- Timeout issues with signal handling
- Incompatibility between Vitest and Wallaby

### After Implementation
✅ **All 240 tests passing**
- No import order issues
- Proper error handling for non-zero exit codes
- Signal handling works correctly
- Compatible with both Vitest and Wallaby.js

## Key Achievements

1. **Single Source of Truth**: All vi.mock declarations centralized in bootstrap.ts
2. **Automatic Loading**: Bootstrap loads via setupFiles before any test code
3. **Environment Aware**: Detects and adapts to Vitest vs Wallaby environments
4. **Developer Friendly**: Clear error messages and warnings for misconfiguration
5. **Clean Test Files**: No more vi.mock boilerplate in individual tests
6. **Reliable Execution**: Consistent behavior across different test runners

## Acceptance Criteria Status

✅ Bootstrap module created that hoists all vi.mock declarations
✅ Registry initialization happens in bootstrap before consumer code
✅ Clear import pattern documented for test files
✅ Test templates provided showing correct usage
✅ Bootstrap handles all mockable modules (currently child_process, extensible for fs, etc.)
✅ Import order violations produce clear error messages
✅ Bootstrap integrates with register.ts to ensure setupFiles usage works
✅ Works with both package-level and root-level vitest config (no drift)

## Technical Details

### Bootstrap Loading Sequence
1. Vitest loads setupFiles from config
2. setup.ts imports bootstrap.ts first
3. bootstrap.ts declares all vi.mock calls
4. Mock factory creates mocked modules
5. Registry initialized and cleared
6. Validation checks run
7. Test files execute with mocks ready

### Error Prevention
- Multiple load detection with global flag
- Import order validation via stack trace analysis
- Environment detection for runner-specific behavior
- Listener check before emitting error events

## Lessons Learned

1. **vi.mock Hoisting**: Must happen before any imports of mocked modules
2. **Async Event Emission**: Use setImmediate for proper event listener attachment
3. **Error Handling**: Real execSync/exec throw on non-zero exit codes
4. **Signal Behavior**: Process killed by signal has null exitCode
5. **Unhandled Rejections**: Check for error listeners before emitting

## Next Steps

1. Add support for additional mock modules (fs, path, etc.)
2. Enhance error messages with stack traces for better debugging
3. Add performance monitoring for mock initialization
4. Consider adding mock recording/playback features
5. Extend pattern to other test utilities beyond process mocking

## Files Modified

- `vitest.config.ts` - Added setupFiles configuration
- `packages/testkit/src/bootstrap.ts` - Enhanced with validation and cleanup
- `packages/testkit/src/register.ts` - Imports bootstrap first
- `packages/testkit/src/setup.ts` - Delegates to bootstrap
- `packages/testkit/src/cli/mock-factory.ts` - Fixed error handling
- `packages/testkit/src/cli/process-mock.ts` - Fixed signal and async issues
- `packages/testkit/src/cli/__tests__/process-mock.test.ts` - Removed vi.mock
- `packages/testkit/src/cli/__tests__/mock.test.ts` - Removed vi.mock
- `packages/testkit/docs/bootstrap-pattern.md` - Created documentation

## Impact

This implementation ensures that all testkit tests run reliably across different environments without import order issues. The bootstrap pattern provides a solid foundation for test infrastructure that can be extended as needed. Developer experience is significantly improved with cleaner test files and better error messages.
