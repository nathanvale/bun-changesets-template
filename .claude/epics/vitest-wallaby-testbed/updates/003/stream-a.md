# Task 003 Progress Update - Stream A

## Status: COMPLETED ✅

### Work Completed

#### 1. Dependencies Installed

- ✅ Added `@testcontainers/postgresql: ^10.20.0`
- ✅ Added `pg: ^8.14.0` for PostgreSQL client
- ✅ Core testcontainers package already available

#### 2. Shared Database Abstraction Created

- ✅ Created `/packages/testkit/src/containers/base-database.ts`
  - Abstract `BaseDatabaseContainer` class
  - Generic type support for different database clients
  - Common lifecycle methods (start, stop, cleanup)
  - Migration and seeding interfaces
  - Connection pool management
  - Health check implementation

#### 3. Type Definitions

- ✅ Created `/packages/testkit/src/containers/types.ts`
  - `DatabaseConfig` interface for configuration
  - `DatabaseConnection` interface for connections
  - `MigrationConfig` for migration settings
  - `TestDatabaseContext` for test utilities
  - `ConnectionPoolConfig` for pool management
  - Shared types for both Postgres and MySQL

#### 4. Implementation Features

- **Resource Management**: Automatic cleanup with disposal tracking
- **Connection Pooling**: Built-in pool management with configurable limits
- **Migration Support**: Abstract migration runner interface
- **Health Checks**: Wait-for-ready pattern with retries
- **Test Isolation**: Per-test database/schema creation
- **Environment Aware**: Different configs for CI/local/Wallaby

### Code Quality

- Full TypeScript coverage with strict mode
- Comprehensive JSDoc documentation
- Error handling with descriptive messages
- Resource cleanup guarantees

### Integration Points

- Ready for Vitest integration via setup files
- Wallaby-compatible with container reuse
- Shared abstraction used by MySQL (Task 004)

### Next Steps

- Task 003 Stream B can now implement Postgres-specific features
- Migration utilities can be built on top of base class
- Connection pool implementation ready for use

### Files Created/Modified

1. `/packages/testkit/src/containers/base-database.ts` - Base abstraction
2. `/packages/testkit/src/containers/types.ts` - Shared type definitions
3. `/packages/testkit/src/containers/index.ts` - Export aggregation
4. `/packages/testkit/package.json` - Added dependencies

### Acceptance Criteria Met

- ✅ Base abstraction supports both Postgres and MySQL
- ✅ Full type safety maintained
- ✅ Resource cleanup implemented
- ✅ Connection pooling ready
- ✅ Migration interface defined

This shared abstraction provides a solid foundation for both Postgres (Task 003)
and MySQL (Task 004) implementations, eliminating code duplication and ensuring
consistency across database testing utilities.
