# Task 001 Stream A Progress Update

## Completed Tasks

### 1. Enhanced testkit package.json
- ✅ Added test:ui and test:coverage scripts
- ✅ Updated devDependencies to include:
  - @template/tooling (workspace reference)
  - @vitest/coverage-v8 (^3.2.4)
  - @vitest/ui (^3.2.4)
  - happy-dom (^18.0.1)
  - tsup (^8.3.5)
- ✅ Maintained existing testing dependencies (vitest, msw, testcontainers, convex-test)
- ✅ Kept peerDependencies for vitest and @vitest/ui

### 2. Created vitest.config.ts
- ✅ Configured for happy-dom environment (suitable for testing utilities)
- ✅ Set up proper test patterns including both src/ and tests/ directories
- ✅ Added setupFiles reference to register.ts
- ✅ Configured coverage with v8 provider
- ✅ Set reasonable timeouts (10s for tests and hooks)
- ✅ Configured thread pool with max 4 threads for performance

### 3. Enhanced tsconfig.json
- ✅ Updated include patterns to cover test files in both src/ and tests/ directories
- ✅ Added support for .test.ts, .test.tsx, .spec.ts file patterns
- ✅ Added vitest/globals and node types for testing support
- ✅ Simplified exclude patterns (removed test file exclusions since we want them included)

## Configuration Details

### Package.json Updates
- Enhanced scripts section with test:ui and test:coverage
- Added comprehensive testing dependencies aligned with monorepo versions
- Maintained workspace protocol for internal dependencies

### Vitest Configuration
- Environment: happy-dom (lightweight DOM for utilities testing)
- Test patterns: Comprehensive coverage of test files in src/ and tests/
- Setup: References existing register.ts for initialization
- Coverage: V8 provider with multiple reporter formats
- Performance: Thread-based execution with optimized pool settings

### TypeScript Configuration
- Includes test files alongside source files
- Added vitest globals type support
- Maintained ESM library configuration inheritance
- Simplified exclusion patterns for better test file inclusion

## Files Modified
- `/packages/testkit/package.json` - Enhanced dependencies and scripts
- `/packages/testkit/vitest.config.ts` - New comprehensive test configuration
- `/packages/testkit/tsconfig.json` - Enhanced to include test files and types

## Ready for Next Steps
The testkit package now has a robust testing foundation that supports:
- Unit testing with vitest
- UI testing capabilities
- Coverage reporting
- Test file organization in both src/ and tests/ directories
- Proper TypeScript support for testing

The configuration follows monorepo patterns and is ready for integration with the broader testing infrastructure.
