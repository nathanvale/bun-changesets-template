# Task: Improve Fix Safety

## Description
Implement ESLint fixTypes configuration to provide different fix modes. Add a "safe" mode for automated/CI runs that only applies layout and suggestion fixes, while maintaining a "full fix" mode for interactive use. Document when each mode should be used.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] ESLint fixTypes configuration implemented
- [ ] "Safe" mode configured for automated/CI runs (layout + suggestions only)
- [ ] "Full fix" mode maintained for interactive use
- [ ] Clear documentation on when each mode should be used
- [ ] CI integration uses safe mode by default
- [ ] Interactive tooling uses full fix mode
- [ ] Configuration is easily togglable

## Technical Details
- Configure ESLint fixTypes to separate safe vs potentially breaking fixes
- Update quality-check tooling to support different fix modes
- Add command-line flags or environment variables to control mode
- Update CI configuration to use safe mode
- Key files affected: ESLint config, quality-check implementation, CI configs

## Dependencies
- [ ] Task 001 (need compilation working)

## Effort Estimate
- Size: M
- Hours: 4-6 hours
- Parallel: true (configuration work)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Code implemented
- [ ] Tests updated and passing
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Code reviewed
- [ ] Quality gates pass
