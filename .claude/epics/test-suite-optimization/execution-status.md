# Test Suite Optimization - Execution Status

## Phase 0: Baseline Capture (In Progress)

### Active Work Streams

**Task #001 - Memory Baseline Capture**
- Status: ✅ Infrastructure Complete
- Files Created:
  - `.claude/metrics/.gitkeep` ✅
  - `scripts/memory-baseline.ts` ✅
  - Analysis file: `001-analysis.md` ✅
- Next Steps: Execute baseline capture
- Agent: Ready for execution

**Task #002 - Zombie Process Documentation**
- Status: 🔄 Scripts Created
- Files Created:
  - `scripts/detect-zombies.sh` ✅
  - Analysis file: `002-analysis.md` ✅
- Next Steps: Document clean state, run scenarios
- Agent: Ready for execution

**Task #003 - Test Execution Metrics**
- Status: 🔄 Scripts Created
- Files Created:
  - `scripts/categorize-tests.sh` ✅
  - Analysis file: `003-analysis.md` ✅
- Next Steps: Configure Vitest, run timing tests
- Agent: Ready for execution

## Queued Work (Blocked - Waiting for Phase 0)

**Task #004 - Zombie Process Tracking System**
- Dependencies: Tasks 001, 002, 003
- Status: ⏸️ Waiting for baseline completion

**Task #005+ - All Subsequent Tasks**
- Dependencies: Phase 0 completion
- Status: ⏸️ Queued for later phases

## Epic Progress

- ✅ Epic branch created: `epic/test-suite-optimization`
- ✅ Task analysis completed for Phase 0 (001-003)
- ✅ Core infrastructure files created
- ✅ Scripts ready for execution
- 🔄 Phase 0 baseline capture in progress

## Next Actions

1. Execute memory baseline capture (Task #001)
2. Document zombie frequency (Task #002)
3. Record test execution metrics (Task #003)
4. Upon Phase 0 completion, proceed to Task #004 (zombie tracking system)

## Files Created This Session

### Infrastructure
- `.claude/metrics/.gitkeep`
- `.claude/epics/test-suite-optimization/execution-status.md`

### Analysis Files
- `.claude/epics/test-suite-optimization/001-analysis.md`
- `.claude/epics/test-suite-optimization/002-analysis.md`
- `.claude/epics/test-suite-optimization/003-analysis.md`

### Implementation Files
- `scripts/memory-baseline.ts` (TypeScript memory profiling)
- `scripts/detect-zombies.sh` (Bash zombie detection)
- `scripts/categorize-tests.sh` (Bash test categorization)

## Coordination Notes

- All Phase 0 tasks can execute in parallel
- Each task has detailed parallel execution plans in analysis files
- Phase 1 (Task #004+) blocked until Phase 0 baseline data captured
- Branch remains clean for parallel agent work
