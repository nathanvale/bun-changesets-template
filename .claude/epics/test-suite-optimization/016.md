# Task 016: Add per-test memory tracking

## Objective

Implement memory tracking for individual tests to identify memory leaks and
high-consumption tests.

## Requirements

### Must Have

- [ ] Track memory before/after each test
- [ ] Identify memory leaks
- [ ] Report high memory tests
- [ ] Integration with test runner
- [ ] Configurable thresholds

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Memory tracked per test
- [ ] Leaks detected and reported
- [ ] High memory tests identified
- [ ] Reports generated automatically

## Dependencies

- Baseline capture mechanism
- Vitest hooks system
- Memory profiling tools
