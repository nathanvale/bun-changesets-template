# Task 020: Reduce excessive mocking

## Objective

- [ ] Identify unnecessary mocks
- [ ] Replace with real implementations
- [ ] Maintain test speed
- [ ] Document mock guidelines

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Mock count reduced to <180
- [ ] Tests still pass reliably
- [ ] No significant speed regression
- [ ] Guidelines documented

## Dependencies

- Understanding of current mocks
- Real implementation availability
- Test refactoring skills
