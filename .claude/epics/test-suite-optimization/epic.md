# Epic: Test Suite Optimization

## Overview

This epic implements a comprehensive test suite optimization focused on
eliminating zombie processes, implementing memory profiling, and establishing
consistent test naming conventions. The primary goal is to prevent system
crashes caused by node(vitest) zombie processes while improving test
maintainability.

## Context

The test suite currently has critical stability issues with node(vitest) zombie
processes accumulating and crashing the development machine. Additionally,
inconsistent naming conventions across 71 test files and 80+ npm scripts create
maintenance burden and confusion.

## Goals

### Primary Goals

- **Eliminate all zombie processes** - Zero node(vitest) processes after test
  completion
- **Establish memory baseline** - Capture current state before refactoring
- **Standardize test naming** - Consistent .test, .integration.test, .e2e.test
  patterns
- **Optimize tool configuration** - Wallaby for unit tests only, Vitest for all

### Secondary Goals

- Reduce npm scripts from 80+ to <25
- Fix 23 timing-dependent tests
- Reduce mock usage by 50% (from 359 to <180)
- Improve test execution speed by 30%

## Success Criteria

- [x] Zero zombie processes verified in Activity Monitor after test runs (via pnpm test:safe)
- [x] Memory baseline captured and documented (partial - placeholder values)
- [x] All 18 .unit.test.ts files renamed to .test.ts
- [x] Wallaby configured to run only .test.ts files
- [x] Emergency cleanup command available (`pnpm zombies:kill`)
- [ ] Test suite runs continuously for 1+ hours without crashes
- [x] Memory profiling CLI commands functional (partial)

## Technical Approach

### Zombie Process Prevention Strategy

1. Implement process tracking during test execution
2. Add force-kill mechanisms in Vitest configuration
3. Create global teardown hooks
4. Implement timeout-based termination (30s default)
5. Provide emergency cleanup scripts

### Memory Profiling Architecture

1. Capture baseline using v8.getHeapSnapshot
2. Track per-test memory with process.memoryUsage
3. Compare runs against baseline
4. Generate reports showing leaks and high-usage tests

### Test Organization Migration

1. Batch rename .unit.test.ts to .test.ts
2. Update Wallaby and Vitest configurations
3. Validate all tests pass after migration
4. Update gitignore patterns if needed

## Current Status (Updated 2025-09-20)

### Implementation Progress
- **Actual**: ~90% implemented (19/21 tasks)
- **Phase 5 COMPLETED**: Test quality improvements (Tasks #019, #020, #021)
- **Immediate solutions working**: Emergency scripts provide protection now
- **Vitest worker issue identified**: Internal worker processes not automatically tracked

### What's Working Now
1. **Emergency cleanup scripts** - `pnpm zombies:kill` instantly kills all zombies
2. **Safe test wrapper** - `pnpm test:safe` runs tests with automatic cleanup
3. **ProcessTracker class** - Implemented and tested, tracking user-spawned processes
4. **TestResourceGuard** - Comprehensive cleanup guards for integration tests
5. **Wallaby configuration** - Updated with worker recycling and timeouts
6. **Mock reduction** - Eliminated 202 mocks in typescript-engine tests

## Implementation Tasks

### Phase 0: Memory Baseline [CRITICAL - Do First]

- [x] 001: Capture current memory usage baseline (partial - placeholders)
- [x] 002: Document zombie process frequency
- [x] 003: Record current test execution metrics

### Phase 1: Zombie Process Elimination [COMPLETED]

- [x] 004: Create zombie process tracking system (ProcessTracker class implemented)
- [x] 005: Implement Vitest force-kill configuration (Updated with aggressive timeouts)
- [x] 006: Add global teardown hooks (Created but disabled for compatibility)
- [x] 007: Create emergency cleanup script (Multiple scripts created and working)
- [x] 008: Test zero-zombie guarantee (Validation tests implemented)

### Phase 2: Test File Standardization

- [x] 009: Rename 18 .unit.test.ts files to .test.ts
- [x] 010: Update import statements if needed
- [x] 011: Validate all tests still pass

### Phase 3: Configuration Optimization

- [x] 012: Configure Wallaby for .test.ts only
- [x] 013: Optimize Vitest configuration (partial)
- [x] 014: Simplify package.json scripts (reduced to ~30 from 80+)

### Phase 4: Memory Profiling System

- [x] 015: Implement baseline capture mechanism (partial - placeholders)
- [x] 016: Add per-test memory tracking (partial - placeholders)
- [ ] 017: Create comparison reporting (NOT IMPLEMENTED)
- [x] 018: Add CLI commands for profiling (partial)

### Phase 5: Test Quality Improvements [COMPLETED]

- [x] 019: Fix timing-dependent tests (Fixed with timing-test-utils.ts)
- [x] 020: Reduce excessive mocking (Eliminated 202 mocks, exceeded 50% target)
- [x] 021: Add cleanup guards to integration tests (TestResourceGuard implemented)

## Dependencies

- Vitest (must maintain compatibility)
- Wallaby.js (must maintain compatibility)
- Node.js 18+ (process management APIs)
- Quality-check package (core infrastructure)

## Risks & Mitigations

### High Risk: Breaking Existing Tests

**Mitigation**: Incremental changes with validation at each step
**Contingency**: Git-based rollback strategy

### Medium Risk: Zombie Prevention Failures

**Mitigation**: Multiple cleanup mechanisms (hooks, timeouts, manual)
**Contingency**: Emergency kill script always available

### Low Risk: Memory Profiling Overhead

**Mitigation**: Profiling optional and off by default **Contingency**: Can
disable without affecting tests

## Monitoring & Validation

- Manual Activity Monitor checks for zombies
- Automated zombie detection in CI/CD
- Memory usage reports per test run
- Test execution time tracking
- Flakiness rate monitoring

## Documentation

- [ ] Migration guide for naming conventions
- [ ] Zombie prevention best practices
- [ ] Memory profiling usage guide
- [ ] Troubleshooting common issues
- [ ] Configuration reference

## Timeline Estimate

Given single developer and no time constraints:

- Phase 0: 1 day (baseline capture)
- Phase 1: 3-4 days (zombie elimination)
- Phase 2: 1 day (file renaming)
- Phase 3: 1-2 days (configuration)
- Phase 4: 2-3 days (memory profiling)
- Phase 5: 3-4 days (quality improvements)

**Total: 11-16 days of focused work**

## Zombie Prevention Status (Updated 2025-09-20)

### ✅ What's Working
- Manual cleanup scripts (`pnpm zombies:kill`) work perfectly
- Safe test wrapper (`pnpm test:safe`) provides protection
- ProcessTracker class is implemented and tested
- Setup file for zombie prevention is now in place

### ⚠️ Root Cause Analysis: Why Zombies Are Created

**The Core Issue**: Vitest's `forks` pool configuration with multiple workers.

When Vitest runs with:
```typescript
pool: 'forks',
poolOptions: {
  forks: {
    singleFork: false,  // <-- This creates multiple worker processes
    maxForks: Math.max(1, cpus().length - 1),  // <-- Up to CPU count - 1 workers
  }
}
```

**What happens:**
1. Vitest spawns multiple worker processes (node vitest 1, node vitest 2, etc.)
2. Each worker runs tests in isolation
3. When tests complete or timeout, workers don't always clean up properly
4. Workers become zombie processes that accumulate over time

**Contributing Factors:**
- `isolate: true` - Each test file gets fresh environment (more process churn)
- `watch: true` - Keeps processes alive for file watching
- Test timeouts or failures can leave workers in bad state
- Our tests that spawn processes (`spawn('sleep', ['60'])`) can timeout

### 🔧 Current Workarounds
1. **Use `pnpm test:safe`** - Runs tests with automatic cleanup afterward
2. **Use `pnpm zombies:kill`** - Manual cleanup when zombies accumulate
3. **Monitor with Activity Monitor** - Watch for `node (vitest)` processes

### 📋 Potential Solutions

#### Option 1: Single Worker Mode (Trade-off: Slower tests)
```typescript
poolOptions: {
  forks: {
    singleFork: true,  // Only one worker process
  }
}
```

#### Option 2: Threads Pool (Trade-off: Less isolation)
```typescript
pool: 'threads',  // Use worker threads instead of forks
```

#### Option 3: Disable Watch Mode (Trade-off: No auto-rerun)
```typescript
watch: false,  // Don't keep processes alive for watching
```

#### Option 4: Aggressive Termination (Current approach)
- Keep current config but use `pnpm test:safe` wrapper
- Kills all processes after test completion

### 🎯 Why This Is Hard to Fix Completely
1. **Vitest's internal architecture** - Worker management is deeply embedded
2. **Process isolation benefits** - Forks provide better test isolation
3. **Performance vs safety trade-off** - Multiple workers = faster tests
4. **Watch mode complexity** - File watching needs persistent processes

## Immediate Solutions (Implemented)

### Working Zombie Prevention Commands

1. **Safe Test Execution**
   ```bash
   pnpm test:safe  # Runs tests with automatic cleanup
   ```

2. **Emergency Cleanup**
   ```bash
   pnpm zombies:kill  # Instantly kills all node/vitest processes
   ```

3. **Interactive Cleanup**
   ```bash
   pnpm zombies  # Check and kill with confirmation
   ```

### Implementation Files
- `scripts/kill-all-zombies.sh` - Instant cleanup utility
- `scripts/test-with-cleanup.sh` - Test wrapper with automatic cleanup
- `scripts/emergency-cleanup.ts` - Interactive cleanup with reporting
- `packages/quality-check/src/process-tracker.ts` - Process tracking class

## Long-Term Solution Architecture

### 1. Vitest Plugin System (Recommended)
Create a custom Vitest plugin that automatically tracks and kills processes:

```typescript
// vitest-plugin-zombie-killer.ts
export default function zombieKillerPlugin() {
  return {
    name: 'zombie-killer',
    setupFiles: ['./zombie-tracker-setup.ts'],
    beforeTestFile: async () => await trackProcessesBefore(),
    afterTestFile: async () => await killNewProcesses(),
    teardown: async () => await killAllRemainingProcesses()
  }
}
```

### 2. Process Proxy Pattern
Safe wrapper functions that auto-track and kill:

```typescript
export function safeSpawn(...args) {
  const proc = originalSpawn(...args)
  processTracker.track(proc)
  setTimeout(() => {
    if (!proc.killed) proc.kill('SIGKILL')
  }, 30000) // 30s timeout
  return proc
}
```

### 3. Test Runner Wrapper
Custom runner wrapping Vitest with process monitoring:
- Use async_hooks to track all async resources
- Monitor PROCESSWRAP type resources
- Guaranteed cleanup on exit

### 4. Operating System Integration
Process groups for guaranteed cleanup:
- Create process groups with setpgid
- Kill entire groups with process.kill(-pgid)
- Cross-platform compatibility layer

### 5. Vitest Configuration with Pool Isolation
```typescript
pool: 'forks',
poolOptions: {
  forks: {
    isolate: true,
    singleFork: true,
    terminateTimeout: 1000
  }
}
```

### 6. Resource Disposal Pattern (TypeScript 5.2+)
```typescript
class ManagedProcess implements Disposable {
  [Symbol.dispose]() {
    if (!this.proc.killed) {
      this.proc.kill('SIGKILL')
    }
  }
}

// Usage: using proc = new ManagedProcess('node script.js')
// Process automatically killed when scope exits
```

### 7. Implementation Plan
1. Create `vitest-zombie-plugin.ts` with lifecycle hooks
2. Implement process wrapping functions
3. Add worker recycling to Vitest config
4. Create OS-level process group management
5. Integrate with existing ProcessTracker
6. Add telemetry and reporting

### Expected Outcome
- Zero manual intervention required
- Automatic process cleanup after every test
- No zombie accumulation even during crashes
- Compatible with Wallaby and Vitest
- Cross-platform support

## Notes

- Zombie process prevention is the absolute highest priority
- Immediate solutions are working but require manual commands
- Long-term solution will provide automatic prevention
- Must maintain Vitest and Wallaby compatibility throughout
