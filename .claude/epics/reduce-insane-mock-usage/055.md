## Objective

Implement comprehensive metrics tracking system to monitor and prevent gradual
regression to excessive mock usage patterns.

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Comprehensive metrics dashboard deployed
- [ ] Automated trend analysis and alerting
- [ ] Historical baseline preservation
- [ ] Team-level and project-level reporting
- [ ] Integration with existing monitoring tools

## Technical Requirements

- Design metrics collection architecture
- Implement data storage and processing pipeline
- Create visualization and reporting dashboard
- Set up automated alerting system
- Integrate with CI/CD and development tools

## Acceptance Criteria

- Real-time visibility into mock usage trends
- Automated alerts for concerning patterns
- Historical data preserved for analysis
- Easy access for teams and leadership
- Actionable insights for continuous improvement

## Implementation Notes

- Leverage existing telemetry infrastructure
- Store metrics with sufficient granularity for analysis
- Implement rolling averages and trend detection
- Create customizable alert thresholds
- Provide drill-down capabilities for investigation

## Dependencies

- Task 051: CI controls with mock density monitoring

## Risks

- Metrics collection performance overhead
- Alert fatigue from false positives
- Data storage and retention considerations
