# Create mock usage enforcement rules in code review

## Description

Establish comprehensive code review guidelines and automation for mock usage
enforcement. This includes creating review templates, automated checks, and team
guidelines to ensure consistent application of the new testing patterns during
the code review process.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Code review checklist includes mock usage validation
- [ ] Automated PR checks flag mock usage violations
- [ ] Review templates guide reviewers on mock best practices
- [ ] Team guidelines document mock usage standards
- [ ] Training materials for code reviewers
- [ ] Integration with existing review workflows
- [ ] Escalation process for mock usage disputes

## Technical Details

### Code Review Automation

1. **PR Template Enhancement**
   - Mock usage checklist items
   - Guidance on when mocks are appropriate
   - Links to alternative patterns

2. **Automated Checks**
   - GitHub Actions bot comments
   - Mock density analysis in PR context
   - Suggestions for mock reduction

3. **Review Guidelines**
   - Clear criteria for mock approval
   - Alternative pattern recommendations
   - Escalation procedures

### Implementation Components

```markdown
# PR Template Addition

## Mock Usage Review

- [ ] Uses real implementations where possible
- [ ] Mocks limited to external dependencies only
- [ ] No more than 2 mocks per test
- [ ] Mock usage justified in comments
- [ ] Alternative patterns considered

## Review Checklist

- Mock density within acceptable limits
- Real implementations preferred
- External dependencies only mocked
- Clear justification for each mock
```

### Automation Features

- **Mock Pattern Detection**: Automated scanning for mock usage patterns
- **Alternative Suggestions**: Bot comments suggesting real implementations
- **Density Warnings**: Automatic warnings for high mock density
- **Historical Context**: Comparison with previous mock usage

## Dependencies

- Task 031: CI controls and monitoring infrastructure
- Existing code review processes
- GitHub Actions automation
- Team training materials

## Effort Estimate

**Size**: Small (1 day)

**Breakdown**:

- Review template creation: 2 hours
- Automation setup: 3 hours
- Guidelines documentation: 2 hours
- Testing and refinement: 1 hour

## Definition of Done

- [ ] PR template includes comprehensive mock usage checklist
- [ ] Automated checks provide actionable feedback
- [ ] Review guidelines clearly documented and accessible
- [ ] Team trained on new review criteria
- [ ] Automation integrated with existing workflows
- [ ] Zero disruption to current review velocity
- [ ] Consistent enforcement across all repositories
- [ ] Feedback loop established for continuous improvement
