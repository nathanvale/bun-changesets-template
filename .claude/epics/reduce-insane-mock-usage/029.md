# Task 029: Validate promotion rule compliance across all tests

**Epic:** reduce-insane-mock-usage **Phase:** Phase 3 - Architecture
Transformation **Created:** 2025-09-20T02:15:00Z **Updated:**
2025-09-20T02:15:00Z **Status:** pending **Size:** Medium **Parallel:** true
**Depends on:** [027]

## Objective

Validate that all tests across the codebase comply with the established
promotion rules and testing principles, ensuring consistent application of the
new testing architecture.

## Success Criteria

- [ ] All tests validated against promotion rules
- [ ] Compliance violations documented and remediated
- [ ] Automated compliance checking implemented
- [ ] Test classification updated to reflect new patterns
- [ ] Performance metrics validated for all test categories
- [ ] Documentation updated with compliance guidelines

## Tasks

1. **Implement compliance checking tools**
   - Create automated tools to scan tests for rule violations
   - Implement linting rules for test patterns
   - Add CI checks for promotion rule compliance

2. **Validate test classifications**
   - Review all test files for proper unit/integration classification
   - Ensure tests follow appropriate mocking boundaries
   - Verify test isolation and independence

3. **Check performance compliance**
   - Validate that unit tests meet performance requirements
   - Ensure integration tests stay within acceptable time limits
   - Monitor memory usage and resource consumption

4. **Audit mock usage**
   - Scan for remaining internal mocks that violate boundaries
   - Verify external mocks use approved patterns (MSW, fakes)
   - Document any justified exceptions with rationale

5. **Update documentation**
   - Update testing guidelines with compliance requirements
   - Create examples of compliant test patterns
   - Document the validation process for future use

## Architecture Impact

- Ensures consistent application of testing principles
- Provides ongoing validation of architectural decisions
- Enables detection of regression in testing practices
- Establishes quality gates for test development

## Testing Strategy

- Automated compliance checking in CI pipeline
- Regular audits of test patterns and performance
- Developer education on compliance requirements
- Continuous monitoring of testing metrics

## Notes

- Depends on completion of architectural transformation (task 027)
- Focus on establishing sustainable compliance processes
- Balance strict compliance with practical development needs
