# Set up temporary file system utilities

## Description

Create robust temporary file system utilities for testing file operations
without relying on mocks or permanent file system changes. This provides
isolated, predictable file system testing that automatically cleans up after
each test.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Temporary directory creation and management utilities
- [ ] File creation and manipulation utilities for tests
- [ ] Directory structure mocking and simulation
- [ ] File permission and metadata testing utilities
- [ ] Automatic cleanup mechanisms for all temporary resources
- [ ] Support for concurrent tests without file conflicts
- [ ] Cross-platform compatibility (Windows, macOS, Linux)
- [ ] Memory-efficient temporary file handling

## Technical Details

### File System Utilities Structure

```typescript
// tests/fixtures/fs/temp.ts
export class TempFileSystem {
  async createTempDir(): Promise<string>
  async createTempFile(content?: string): Promise<string>
  async setupDirectoryStructure(structure: object): Promise<string>
  async cleanup(): Promise<void>
}
```

### Key Components

1. **Temp Directory Manager**: Creates isolated temporary directories
2. **File Builder**: Utilities for creating files with specific content/metadata
3. **Directory Structure Builder**: Creates complex directory hierarchies
4. **Permission Manager**: Sets and tests file permissions
5. **Content Generator**: Creates files with realistic content for testing
6. **Cleanup Registry**: Tracks and cleans up all temporary resources

### Temporary Resource Management

- Unique temporary directories per test or test suite
- Automatic registration of created files/directories for cleanup
- Graceful cleanup on test failure or interruption
- Memory-mapped file alternatives for large file testing
- Symlink and hardlink testing utilities

### Cross-Platform Considerations

- Path handling with proper separators
- Permission testing adapted to platform capabilities
- File system event testing (watching, notifications)
- Case sensitivity handling for different file systems
- Long path support on Windows

### Content Generation

- Binary file generation for testing file uploads
- Text file generation with various encodings
- Image/media file stubs for multimedia testing
- Configuration file templates
- Log file simulation utilities

### Integration Patterns

- Easy integration with file processing tests
- Configuration file testing utilities
- Log file parsing and analysis testing
- File upload/download simulation
- Archive (zip/tar) creation and extraction testing

## Dependencies

- **Task 002**: Requires shared fixtures directory structure
- **Node.js fs/promises**: Core file system operations
- **OS temp utilities**: Platform-specific temporary directory handling

## Effort Estimate

**Size**: Small (1 day)

- Morning: Implement core temporary file system utilities
- Afternoon: Add cleanup mechanisms, cross-platform support, and testing

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Temporary file system utilities are fully functional
- [ ] Automatic cleanup prevents file system pollution
- [ ] Cross-platform compatibility is verified
- [ ] Concurrent test execution doesn't cause file conflicts
- [ ] Memory usage is optimized for large file testing
- [ ] Integration with test lifecycle is seamless
- [ ] Documentation covers common file testing patterns
- [ ] Error handling gracefully manages cleanup on failures
