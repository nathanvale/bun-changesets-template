# Task: Create test tier directory structure in root and all packages

## Description

Establish the new tiered test directory structure across the repository and all
packages. This creates the foundation for the organized, mock-free testing
approach with clear separation between test types.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] test/unit directories created in root and all packages
- [ ] test/integration directories created in root and all packages
- [ ] test/e2e directories created in root and all packages
- [ ] test/fixtures directories created for shared test data
- [ ] Directory structure documented and standardized

## Technical Details

- Create consistent directory structure: test/{unit,integration,e2e,fixtures}
- Add .gitkeep files to maintain empty directories in git
- Set up proper TypeScript path mappings for test directories
- Ensure consistent naming conventions across all packages
- Document tier definitions and usage guidelines

## Dependencies

- [ ] Legacy test files moved to test-legacy (task 000.2)
- [ ] Clear understanding of test tier definitions
- [ ] Write access to all package directories

## Effort Estimate

- Size: Medium
- Hours: 3-4 hours
- Parallel: true

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Complete test tier structure implemented
- [ ] All packages have consistent directory layout
- [ ] TypeScript configuration updated for new paths
- [ ] Documentation created for test tier usage
- [ ] Team alignment on new structure confirmed
