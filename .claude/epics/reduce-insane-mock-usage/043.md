# Task 043: Migrate integration tests with mock reduction

## Overview

Comprehensive migration of integration tests from legacy structure with
significant mock reduction and improved real service integration.

## Context

- Part of Phase 4: Legacy Test Migration & Refactoring
- Most complex migration due to integration test nature
- Critical for establishing proper integration test patterns

## Objectives

- Migrate integration tests to new test tier structure
- Replace mocks with real service integrations where appropriate
- Implement proper test isolation and cleanup
- Establish integration test best practices
- Ensure tests work with new infrastructure

## Tasks

- [ ] Analyze existing integration test mock patterns
- [ ] Design real service integration strategies
- [ ] Set up test databases and external service connections
- [ ] Migrate tests batch by batch to manage complexity
- [ ] Implement proper test data setup and teardown
- [ ] Replace service mocks with real implementations
- [ ] Configure test environment isolation
- [ ] Update CI/CD pipeline for integration tests
- [ ] Validate test stability and performance
- [ ] Document integration test patterns and guidelines

## Success Criteria

- All integration tests migrated to new structure
- Dramatic reduction in mock usage (80%+ reduction)
- Tests use real services with proper isolation
- Stable test execution in CI/CD pipeline
- Clear integration test documentation and patterns

## Dependencies

- depends_on: [041, 042] (Assessment and unit test migration)
