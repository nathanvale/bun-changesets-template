# Task 046: Deprecate obsolete or redundant legacy tests

## Overview

Identify and deprecate legacy tests that are obsolete, redundant, or provide
minimal value, reducing maintenance burden and test suite complexity.

## Context

- Part of Phase 4: Legacy Test Migration & Refactoring
- Focuses on cleaning up test technical debt
- Critical for streamlining the test suite

## Objectives

- Identify tests with minimal or no business value
- Remove redundant test coverage
- Deprecate tests for obsolete features
- Clean up test technical debt
- Reduce overall test maintenance burden

## Tasks

- [ ] Analyze test assessment results for low-value tests
- [ ] Identify redundant tests covering same functionality
- [ ] Map tests to current feature set to find obsolete coverage
- [ ] Evaluate test maintenance cost vs value
- [ ] Create deprecation plan with stakeholder review
- [ ] Mark tests for deprecation with clear reasoning
- [ ] Remove or archive deprecated tests
- [ ] Update test documentation to reflect changes
- [ ] Validate coverage gaps after deprecation
- [ ] Document deprecation criteria for future use

## Success Criteria

- Clear identification of obsolete and redundant tests
- Systematic deprecation with stakeholder approval
- Reduced test suite size without coverage loss
- Improved test suite maintainability
- Documented criteria for future test deprecation
