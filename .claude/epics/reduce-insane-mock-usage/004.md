# Task: Create test database utilities (SQLite in-memory)

## Description

Implement SQLite in-memory database utilities for integration tests. This
provides real database interactions without the overhead and complexity of
external database dependencies.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] SQLite in-memory database setup utilities
- [ ] Schema migration and seeding capabilities
- [ ] Transaction isolation between tests
- [ ] Database cleanup and reset mechanisms
- [ ] Connection pooling and lifecycle management

## Technical Details

- Configure SQLite with :memory: database instances
- Implement schema migration utilities for test setup
- Create seeding functions for common test scenarios
- Set up automatic transaction rollback between tests
- Provide database inspection and debugging utilities

## Dependencies

- [ ] Test tier directories created (task 001)
- [ ] SQLite package and drivers installed
- [ ] Understanding of application database schema

## Effort Estimate

- Size: Medium
- Hours: 4-6 hours
- Parallel: true

## Definition of Done

- [ ] SQLite in-memory database utilities functional
- [ ] Schema migration system working
- [ ] Test isolation mechanisms verified
- [ ] Database cleanup automated
- [ ] Documentation and usage examples complete
