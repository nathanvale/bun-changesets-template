# Task: Eliminate console output mocking (target: -150 mocks)

## Description

Remove all console output mocking across the test suite. Replace with
assertion-based approaches that verify actual behavior rather than suppressing
output. This targets the most common and unnecessary mock usage pattern.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] All console.log/warn/error mocks removed
- [ ] Output suppression replaced with actual output verification
- [ ] Test runner configuration updated for quiet mode
- [ ] Assertion patterns established for output testing
- [ ] Target reduction of 150+ mock instances achieved

## Technical Details

- Remove all jest.spyOn(console, ...) and vi.spyOn(console, ...) calls
- Replace with actual output capture and verification where needed
- Configure test runner for appropriate output levels
- Establish patterns for testing components that produce output
- Ensure no test functionality is lost in the transition

## Dependencies

- [ ] Mock usage audit completed (task 011)
- [ ] Understanding of console output testing needs
- [ ] Test runner output configuration

## Effort Estimate

- Size: Large
- Hours: 6-8 hours
- Parallel: true

## Definition of Done

- [ ] All console mocks eliminated
- [ ] Output verification patterns established
- [ ] Test runner properly configured
- [ ] All affected tests still functional
- [ ] Target mock reduction achieved
