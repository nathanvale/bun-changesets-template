# Implement automated promotion rule enforcement

## Description

Implement automated enforcement of the >2 mock promotion rules, ensuring that
tests exceeding mock density thresholds are automatically promoted to
integration tests with appropriate infrastructure and configuration. This
prevents circumvention of density limits while maintaining test coverage.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Automatic detection of tests exceeding 2 mock limit
- [ ] Automated promotion to integration test suite
- [ ] Configuration updates for promoted tests
- [ ] Notification system for test promotions
- [ ] Integration with existing CI pipeline
- [ ] Rollback mechanism for incorrect promotions
- [ ] Audit trail for all promotion decisions

## Technical Details

### Promotion Detection

1. **Mock Count Analysis**
   - Parse test files for mock creation patterns
   - Identify tests exceeding density thresholds
   - Validate promotion candidates

2. **Automated Actions**
   - Move tests to integration suite
   - Update test configuration
   - Modify CI pipeline inclusion
   - Generate promotion reports

3. **Quality Assurance**
   - Validate test functionality post-promotion
   - Ensure proper infrastructure allocation
   - Verify test isolation maintained

### Implementation Components

```typescript
// Promotion service interface
interface TestPromoter {
  analyzeTestFile(filePath: string): PromotionAnalysis
  promoteTest(testId: string, reason: string): PromotionResult
  validatePromotion(testId: string): ValidationResult
  rollbackPromotion(testId: string): RollbackResult
}

// Promotion configuration
interface PromotionConfig {
  mockThreshold: 2
  integrationSuitePath: string
  resourceLimits: ResourceConfig
  notificationChannels: string[]
}
```

### Automation Workflow

1. **Detection Phase**
   - CI scans for mock density violations
   - Identifies promotion candidates
   - Validates promotion appropriateness

2. **Promotion Phase**
   - Moves test files to integration suite
   - Updates configuration and metadata
   - Adjusts CI pipeline execution

3. **Validation Phase**
   - Runs promoted tests in new environment
   - Verifies functionality preservation
   - Generates promotion report

### Integration Points

- Existing CI pipeline configuration
- Test file organization structure
- Mock detection infrastructure
- Team notification systems

## Dependencies

- Task 029: Real implementation patterns established
- Task 031: CI controls and mock monitoring operational
- Existing test infrastructure and CI pipeline
- Integration test environment setup

## Effort Estimate

**Size**: Medium (2 days)

**Breakdown**:

- Detection logic implementation: 5 hours
- Promotion automation: 4 hours
- CI integration: 3 hours
- Testing and validation: 4 hours

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Tests exceeding mock limits automatically promoted
- [ ] Promotion process maintains test functionality
- [ ] Team notified of all promotion decisions
- [ ] CI pipeline handles promoted tests correctly
- [ ] Rollback mechanism tested and functional
- [ ] Audit trail captures all promotion activities
- [ ] Zero manual intervention required for promotions
- [ ] Integration test environment handles promoted load
