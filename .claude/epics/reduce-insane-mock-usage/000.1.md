# Task: Create test-legacy folders in root and all packages with existing tests

## Description

Create `test-legacy` directories in the repository root and all packages that
currently contain test files. This will serve as the safe preservation location
for existing tests during the migration process.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] test-legacy folder created in repository root
- [ ] test-legacy folders created in all packages with existing tests
- [ ] Directory structure documented
- [ ] Folder permissions properly set
- [ ] Git tracking enabled for new directories

## Technical Details

- Scan packages/ directory for existing test files
- Create test-legacy directories using consistent naming
- Ensure .gitkeep files are added to empty directories
- Maintain package-level isolation for test preservation
- Document folder structure for team reference

## Dependencies

- [ ] Complete audit from task 000 (existing test locations)
- [ ] Write access to all package directories

## Effort Estimate

- Size: Small
- Hours: 2-3 hours
- Parallel: true

## Definition of Done

- [ ] All test-legacy directories created
- [ ] Directory structure documented
- [ ] Git tracking properly configured
- [ ] Team notification sent
- [ ] Ready for test file migration
