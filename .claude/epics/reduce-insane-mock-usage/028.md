## Objective

Complete the comprehensive test fixture library that provides reusable patterns,
builders, and utilities for consistent test data creation and management across
the entire codebase.

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Complete test fixture library with builders for all domain entities
- [ ] Reusable test patterns for common scenarios documented
- [ ] Test utilities for database seeding and cleanup
- [ ] Helper functions for complex test data relationships
- [ ] Performance-optimized fixture creation patterns
- [ ] Documentation and examples for fixture usage

## Tasks

1. **Complete entity builders**
   - Finish builders for all domain entities
   - Add builder methods for complex relationships
   - Implement factory patterns for common entity combinations

2. **Add scenario builders**
   - Create builders for common business scenarios
   - Implement test data patterns for workflows
   - Add utilities for multi-step process testing

3. **Implement database utilities**
   - Create database seeding utilities for integration tests
   - Add cleanup and isolation helpers
   - Implement transaction-based test isolation patterns

4. **Add assertion helpers**
   - Create domain-specific assertion utilities
   - Implement comparison helpers for complex objects
   - Add validation utilities for business rules

5. **Create documentation and examples**
   - Document fixture library usage patterns
   - Create examples for common testing scenarios
   - Add best practices guide for fixture usage

## Architecture Impact

- Provides consistent test data creation across all tests
- Reduces test setup complexity and maintenance burden
- Enables easier test creation and more comprehensive coverage
- Establishes patterns for maintainable test suites

## Testing Strategy

- Test the fixture library itself for reliability
- Performance benchmarks for fixture creation
- Usage examples that serve as integration tests
- Documentation validation through real usage

## Notes

- Builds on foundation from task 009
- Integrates with adapter patterns from task 021
- Focus on ease of use and performance for daily development
