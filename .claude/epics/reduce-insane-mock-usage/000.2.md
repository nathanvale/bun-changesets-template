# Task: Move existing test files to test-legacy folders for safe preservation

## Description

Safely move all existing test files from their current locations to the newly
created test-legacy folders. This ensures preservation of existing tests while
clearing space for the new test organization structure.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] All existing test files moved to test-legacy folders
- [ ] Original directory structure preserved within test-legacy
- [ ] Git history maintained for moved files
- [ ] No test files lost during migration
- [ ] Moved files remain executable and functional

## Technical Details

- Use `git mv` commands to preserve file history
- Maintain relative directory structure within test-legacy
- Verify all test files are accounted for using checksums
- Update any relative import paths that may be affected
- Create backup verification before and after migration

## Dependencies

- [ ] test-legacy directories created (task 000.1)
- [ ] Complete inventory of test file locations
- [ ] Git repository in clean state

## Effort Estimate

- Size: Medium
- Hours: 4-6 hours
- Parallel: false (sequential to avoid conflicts)

## Definition of Done

- [ ] All test files safely moved to test-legacy
- [ ] Git history preserved for all moved files
- [ ] Migration verification report completed
- [ ] No missing or corrupted test files
- [ ] Ready for new test structure implementation
