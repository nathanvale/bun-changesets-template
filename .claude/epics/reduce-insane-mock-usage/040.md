# Set up ongoing monitoring and alerting

## Description

Establish production-grade monitoring and alerting systems to ensure sustained
success of the mock reduction initiative. This includes long-term health
monitoring, regression detection, and proactive alerts to maintain the
improvements achieved during the epic.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Production monitoring dashboard operational
- [ ] Automated alerting for regression detection
- [ ] Regular health reports generated automatically
- [ ] Integration with existing monitoring infrastructure
- [ ] Escalation procedures for critical issues
- [ ] Historical trend analysis capabilities
- [ ] Self-healing mechanisms where appropriate

## Technical Details

### Monitoring Infrastructure

1. **Core Health Metrics**
   - Mock density trends over time
   - Test reliability rates
   - Build performance metrics
   - Team adoption compliance

2. **Regression Detection**
   - Automated alerts for mock creep
   - Performance degradation warnings
   - Test reliability drops
   - Pattern compliance violations

3. **Predictive Analytics**
   - Trend analysis for early warning
   - Risk scoring for code changes
   - Team behavior pattern recognition
   - Resource usage forecasting

### Alert Configuration

```yaml
# Monitoring Configuration
alerts:
  mock_density_increase:
    threshold: 15%
    severity: warning
    channels: [slack, email]

  test_reliability_drop:
    threshold: 90%
    severity: critical
    channels: [slack, pager]

  pattern_compliance:
    threshold: 85%
    severity: warning
    channels: [slack]

dashboards:
  team_health:
    metrics: [mock_density, test_reliability, build_time]
    refresh: 5m

  trend_analysis:
    metrics: [historical_trends, predictions]
    refresh: 1h
```

### Automation Features

- **Self-Healing**: Automated responses to common issues
- **Report Generation**: Weekly/monthly health summaries
- **Threshold Adjustment**: Dynamic thresholds based on historical data
- **Integration Points**: Existing monitoring tools and communication channels

### Long-term Sustainability

- **Maintenance Procedures**: Regular review and update processes
- **Knowledge Transfer**: Documentation for ongoing support teams
- **Evolution Strategy**: Adaptation to changing codebase needs
- **Cost Optimization**: Efficient resource usage monitoring

## Dependencies

- Task 035: Metrics tracking infrastructure established
- Task 038: Success criteria validation completed
- Existing monitoring and alerting infrastructure
- Team communication and escalation procedures

## Effort Estimate

**Size**: Small (1 day)

**Breakdown**:

- Production monitoring setup: 3 hours
- Alert configuration and testing: 2 hours
- Dashboard creation: 2 hours
- Documentation and handover: 1 hour

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Production monitoring operational 24/7
- [ ] Automated alerts configured and tested
- [ ] Regular health reports being generated
- [ ] Integration with existing systems seamless
- [ ] Escalation procedures documented and tested
- [ ] Historical data collection and analysis functional
- [ ] Team trained on monitoring tools and procedures
- [ ] Long-term sustainability plan documented and approved
