# Task 041: Assess and categorize all legacy tests for migration readiness

## Overview

Comprehensive assessment and categorization of all existing legacy tests to
determine migration strategies and priorities.

## Context

- Part of Phase 4: Legacy Test Migration & Refactoring
- Foundation task for all other migration efforts
- Critical for understanding current test landscape

## Objectives

- Create comprehensive inventory of all legacy tests
- Categorize tests by type, quality, and migration complexity
- Identify high-value tests worth preserving
- Flag obsolete or redundant tests for deprecation
- Assess mock usage patterns across legacy test suite

## Tasks

- [ ] Scan all test directories and catalog existing tests
- [ ] Analyze test file structure and naming conventions
- [ ] Categorize tests by: unit/integration/e2e, mock usage level, business
      value
- [ ] Identify tests with excessive mock usage (>5 mocks per test)
- [ ] Document test dependencies and shared fixtures
- [ ] Assess test maintenance burden and flakiness
- [ ] Create migration priority matrix based on value vs effort
- [ ] Generate detailed migration roadmap for each category

## Success Criteria

- Complete inventory of all legacy tests with metadata
- Clear categorization system with migration priorities
- Documented assessment of mock usage patterns
- Migration roadmap with effort estimates
- Identification of quick wins vs complex migrations

## Dependencies

- depends_on: [030] (Test Quality Guidelines)
