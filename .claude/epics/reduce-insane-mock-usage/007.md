# Task: Update Vitest configuration with proper teardown

## Description

Update Vitest configuration to integrate all test utilities (MSW, database, file
system, time/random) with proper setup and teardown mechanisms. This ensures
clean test isolation and reliable test execution.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Vitest config updated with all test utilities
- [ ] Global setup hooks for MSW, database, etc.
- [ ] Proper teardown and cleanup mechanisms
- [ ] Test isolation between test runs
- [ ] Environment-specific configuration options

## Technical Details

- Configure global test setup for all utilities
- Implement proper cleanup hooks and teardown sequences
- Set up test isolation mechanisms to prevent state leakage
- Configure environment-specific settings (CI, local, Wallaby)
- Ensure all async cleanup operations complete properly

## Dependencies

- [ ] Shared fixtures system (task 002)
- [ ] MSW server setup (task 003)
- [ ] Database utilities (task 004)
- [ ] File system utilities (task 005)
- [ ] Time/random utilities (task 006)

## Effort Estimate

- Size: Medium
- Hours: 3-5 hours
- Parallel: false (requires integration of all utilities)

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Vitest configuration fully updated
- [ ] All utilities properly integrated
- [ ] Setup and teardown working correctly
- [ ] Test isolation verified
- [ ] Configuration documented and tested
