# Update Vitest configuration with proper teardown

## Description

Update Vitest configuration to integrate all the new testing utilities (MSW, database, file system, time/random) with proper teardown sequences. This ensures that all resources are properly cleaned up and tests run in complete isolation without zombies or resource leaks.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Vitest configuration integrates MSW server lifecycle
- [ ] Database utilities are properly initialized and cleaned up
- [ ] Temporary file system resources are automatically cleaned up
- [ ] Fake time and random utilities are reset between tests
- [ ] Global setup and teardown hooks are properly configured
- [ ] Test isolation is guaranteed across all test tiers
- [ ] Memory leaks are prevented through proper resource management
- [ ] Error handling ensures cleanup even when tests fail

## Technical Details

### Configuration Structure
```typescript
// vitest.config.ts updates
export default defineConfig({
  test: {
    setupFiles: [
      './tests/fixtures/setup/global.ts',
      './tests/fixtures/setup/msw.ts',
      './tests/fixtures/setup/database.ts',
      './tests/fixtures/setup/filesystem.ts',
      './tests/fixtures/setup/time.ts'
    ],
    globalSetup: './tests/fixtures/setup/global-setup.ts',
    globalTeardown: './tests/fixtures/setup/global-teardown.ts'
  }
})
```

### Setup File Organization
1. **Global Setup**: Initialize shared resources and registries
2. **MSW Setup**: Configure Mock Service Worker lifecycle
3. **Database Setup**: Initialize database utilities and cleanup
4. **File System Setup**: Configure temporary file management
5. **Time/Random Setup**: Initialize deterministic utilities
6. **Cleanup Registry**: Central resource tracking for teardown

### Teardown Sequence
- Individual test teardown: Reset test-specific state
- Suite teardown: Clean up suite-level resources
- Global teardown: Final cleanup of shared resources
- Error handling: Cleanup on test failures and interruptions
- Resource leak detection: Verify all resources are properly released

### Integration Points
- beforeAll/afterAll hooks for resource initialization
- beforeEach/afterEach hooks for test isolation
- Error handling to ensure cleanup on test failures
- Parallel test execution support with resource isolation
- Environment-specific configuration (CI, local, Wallaby)

### Resource Management
- Central registry for tracking all created resources
- Automatic cleanup registration when resources are created
- Graceful handling of cleanup failures
- Resource usage monitoring and leak detection
- Performance optimization for rapid test execution

### Error Handling Strategy
- Cleanup continues even if individual teardown steps fail
- Error aggregation to report multiple teardown issues
- Fallback cleanup mechanisms for critical resources
- Detailed logging for debugging teardown issues
- Timeout handling for cleanup operations

## Dependencies

- **Task 003**: MSW server setup must be complete
- **Task 004**: Database utilities must be implemented
- **Task 005**: File system utilities must be ready
- **Task 006**: Time/random utilities must be available

## Effort Estimate

**Size**: Medium (2 days)
- Day 1: Integrate all utilities into Vitest configuration and setup files
- Day 2: Implement comprehensive teardown sequences and error handling

## Definition of Done

- [ ] All testing utilities are integrated into Vitest configuration
- [ ] Setup and teardown sequences execute in correct order
- [ ] Test isolation is guaranteed across all test tiers
- [ ] Resource cleanup is comprehensive and automatic
- [ ] Error handling ensures cleanup even on test failures
- [ ] Memory leaks are prevented through proper resource management
- [ ] Performance impact on test execution is minimized
- [ ] Configuration supports both local development and CI environments
