# Task 047: Consolidate duplicate test coverage across legacy tests

## Overview

Identify and consolidate duplicate test coverage across the legacy test suite,
merging redundant tests to reduce maintenance overhead while preserving
comprehensive coverage.

## Context

- Part of Phase 4: Legacy Test Migration & Refactoring
- Addresses test duplication and overlap issues
- Critical for optimizing test suite efficiency

## Objectives

- Identify overlapping test coverage across legacy tests
- Consolidate duplicate tests into comprehensive coverage
- Reduce test execution time and maintenance burden
- Ensure no coverage gaps during consolidation
- Establish patterns for preventing future duplication

## Tasks

- [ ] Map test coverage across all legacy test files
- [ ] Identify tests covering identical functionality
- [ ] Analyze coverage overlap and redundancy patterns
- [ ] Design consolidation strategy preserving edge cases
- [ ] Merge duplicate tests into comprehensive test cases
- [ ] Validate consolidated tests maintain full coverage
- [ ] Update test names and documentation for clarity
- [ ] Remove redundant test files after consolidation
- [ ] Update CI/CD pipeline for optimized test execution
- [ ] Document consolidation patterns and guidelines

## Success Criteria

- Complete mapping of duplicate test coverage
- Successful consolidation without coverage loss
- Reduced test execution time (target: 30% improvement)
- Fewer test files with better organization
- Clear guidelines for preventing future duplication
