# Set up flake quarantining with hanging process detection

## Description

Implement automated detection and quarantine system for flaky tests, with
special focus on hanging process detection. This system will automatically
identify tests that fail intermittently or hang, quarantine them from regular CI
runs, and provide tooling for systematic resolution.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Automatic flaky test detection based on failure patterns
- [ ] Hanging process detection with configurable timeouts
- [ ] Quarantine system isolates problematic tests
- [ ] Dedicated CI pipeline for quarantined test resolution
- [ ] Integration with existing zombie prevention measures
- [ ] Notification system for new quarantined tests
- [ ] Metrics tracking flake reduction progress

## Technical Details

### Flake Detection Algorithm

1. **Statistical Analysis**
   - Track test success/failure rates over time
   - Identify tests with < 95% success rate
   - Detect intermittent hanging patterns

2. **Hanging Process Detection**
   - Timeout-based detection (configurable per test type)
   - Process tree analysis for zombie detection
   - Resource usage monitoring

3. **Quarantine Mechanism**
   - Automatic test isolation
   - Separate test suite for quarantined tests
   - Controlled re-integration process

### Implementation Components

```typescript
// Flake detection service
interface FlakeDetector {
  analyzeTestHistory(testId: string): FlakeAnalysis
  detectHangingProcesses(): HangingProcess[]
  quarantineTest(testId: string, reason: string): void
  scheduleReintegration(testId: string): void
}

// Configuration
interface FlakeConfig {
  successRateThreshold: 0.95
  hangingTimeoutMs: 30000
  quarantineDurationDays: 7
  maxConsecutiveFailures: 3
}
```

### Integration Points

- Vitest timeout configuration
- GitHub Actions workflow modifications
- Existing zombie prevention (vitest.force-kill.setup.ts)
- Quality gate enforcement

## Dependencies

- Task 008: Zombie prevention mechanisms in place
- Task 030: Quality gates and monitoring infrastructure
- Existing test infrastructure and CI pipeline
- Wallaby integration for real-time feedback

## Effort Estimate

**Size**: Medium (2 days)

**Breakdown**:

- Flake detection algorithm: 6 hours
- Quarantine system implementation: 4 hours
- CI integration and workflows: 3 hours
- Testing and validation: 3 hours

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Flaky tests automatically detected and quarantined
- [ ] Hanging processes caught before causing CI delays
- [ ] Quarantined tests run in separate pipeline
- [ ] Team notifications for new quarantined tests
- [ ] Reintegration process functional and documented
- [ ] Integration with existing zombie prevention
- [ ] Zero impact on stable test execution
- [ ] Comprehensive monitoring and alerting operational
