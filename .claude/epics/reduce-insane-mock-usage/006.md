# Task: Implement fake time/random utilities

## Description

Create utilities for controlling time and randomness in tests. This enables
deterministic testing of time-dependent and random behavior without complex
mocking setups.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Fake timer utilities with controllable time advancement
- [ ] Seeded random number generation for repeatability
- [ ] Date/time manipulation helpers
- [ ] Automatic timer cleanup between tests
- [ ] Integration with test runner lifecycle

## Technical Details

- Implement controlled time advancement using fake timers
- Create seeded random utilities for predictable randomness
- Set up automatic timer and random state cleanup
- Provide date/time manipulation helpers for test scenarios
- Ensure compatibility with async operations and promises

## Dependencies

- [ ] Test tier directories created (task 001)
- [ ] Understanding of time-dependent test requirements
- [ ] Vitest fake timer integration

## Effort Estimate

- Size: Small
- Hours: 2-4 hours
- Parallel: true

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Fake time utilities functional and tested
- [ ] Seeded random generation working
- [ ] Automatic cleanup mechanisms verified
- [ ] Time manipulation helpers complete
- [ ] Documentation with usage examples
