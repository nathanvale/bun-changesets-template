# Create troubleshooting guide for new test patterns

## Description

Create comprehensive troubleshooting documentation for common issues encountered when implementing new testing patterns. This guide will help developers quickly resolve problems and maintain confidence in the real implementation approach.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Troubleshooting guide covers all common migration issues
- [ ] Step-by-step solutions for typical problems
- [ ] Code examples demonstrating fixes
- [ ] Integration with existing documentation
- [ ] Searchable format for quick problem resolution
- [ ] Regular updates based on team feedback
- [ ] Links to relevant tools and resources

## Technical Details

### Common Issues Covered

1. **Performance Problems**
   - Slow test execution with real services
   - Memory usage optimization
   - Database cleanup strategies

2. **Setup Complications**
   - Service initialization failures
   - Configuration management
   - Environment-specific issues

3. **Reliability Issues**
   - Intermittent test failures
   - Resource contention
   - Timing-related problems

4. **Migration Challenges**
   - Converting existing mocked tests
   - Maintaining test isolation
   - Handling external dependencies

### Guide Structure

```markdown
