# Task: Implement MSW server setup and configuration

## Description

Set up Mock Service Worker (MSW) for realistic HTTP request mocking. This
provides a robust alternative to traditional mocking approaches while
maintaining network-level isolation for tests.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] MSW server configuration for Node.js environment
- [ ] Request handlers for common API patterns
- [ ] Global setup and teardown mechanisms
- [ ] Error response simulation capabilities
- [ ] Integration with Vitest test runner

## Technical Details

- Configure MSW with setupServer for Node.js environment
- Create modular request handlers organized by domain
- Implement response factories with realistic data
- Set up automatic server lifecycle management
- Provide debugging and inspection utilities

## Dependencies

- [ ] Test tier directories created (task 001)
- [ ] MSW package installed and configured
- [ ] Understanding of application API patterns

## Effort Estimate

- Size: Medium
- Hours: 5-6 hours
- Parallel: true

## Definition of Done

- [ ] MSW server fully configured and functional
- [ ] Request handlers for major API endpoints
- [ ] Global setup integrated with test runner
- [ ] Error simulation patterns implemented
- [ ] Documentation and examples provided
