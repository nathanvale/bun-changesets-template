# Implement MSW server setup and configuration

## Description

Set up Mock Service Worker (MSW) infrastructure to provide reliable HTTP mocking
capabilities. This will replace brittle HTTP mocks with a robust,
browser-compatible mocking solution that works consistently across different
test environments.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] MSW dependency installed and configured
- [ ] Base MSW server setup in `tests/fixtures/servers/`
- [ ] HTTP request/response handlers for common API patterns
- [ ] Integration with Vitest test lifecycle
- [ ] Support for both Node.js and browser environments
- [ ] Configurable mock responses with realistic data
- [ ] Error scenario simulation capabilities
- [ ] Request verification and assertion utilities

## Technical Details

### MSW Configuration

```typescript
// tests/fixtures/servers/msw.ts
export const server = setupServer(...handlers)

// Lifecycle integration
beforeAll(() => server.listen())
afterEach(() => server.resetHandlers())
afterAll(() => server.close())
```

### Handler Organization

- REST API handlers for common endpoints
- GraphQL handlers if applicable
- WebSocket mocking capabilities
- File upload/download simulation
- Authentication and authorization flows

### Implementation Components

1. **Base Server Setup**: Core MSW server configuration
2. **Handler Registry**: Organized collection of request handlers
3. **Response Builders**: Utilities for creating realistic responses
4. **Test Integration**: Seamless integration with test frameworks
5. **Environment Detection**: Automatic Node.js vs browser setup

### Error Handling

- Network failure simulation
- Timeout scenarios
- HTTP error status codes
- Malformed response testing
- Rate limiting simulation

## Dependencies

- **Task 002**: Requires shared fixtures directory structure
- **MSW Package**: Mock Service Worker npm package
- **Vitest Integration**: Compatible with existing test setup

## Effort Estimate

**Size**: Medium (2 days)

- Day 1: Install MSW, create base server setup and core handlers
- Day 2: Implement response builders, error scenarios, and test integration

## Definition of Done

- [ ] MSW server properly configured and integrated
- [ ] Common API patterns have corresponding handlers
- [ ] Error scenarios can be reliably simulated
- [ ] Integration with Vitest lifecycle is seamless
- [ ] Documentation for adding new handlers is complete
- [ ] No conflicts with existing test infrastructure
- [ ] Can run in parallel with other foundation tasks (with file coordination)
