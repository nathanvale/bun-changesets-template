# Task: Establish test builder patterns for common entities

## Description

Create builder pattern utilities for common domain entities and objects used
throughout tests. This provides a consistent, fluent API for creating test data
while reducing duplication and improving maintainability.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Builder classes for major domain entities
- [ ] Fluent API for customizing test objects
- [ ] Default values for all entity properties
- [ ] Composition patterns for related entities
- [ ] TypeScript type safety throughout

## Technical Details

- Implement builder pattern for core domain objects
- Create fluent API with method chaining
- Set up sensible defaults for all properties
- Enable easy customization of specific properties
- Ensure full TypeScript type checking and IntelliSense

## Dependencies

- [ ] Shared fixtures system (task 002)
- [ ] Understanding of domain entity structure
- [ ] TypeScript configuration for builders

## Effort Estimate

- Size: Medium
- Hours: 4-5 hours
- Parallel: true

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Builder patterns implemented for common entities
- [ ] Fluent API functional and type-safe
- [ ] Default values established and documented
- [ ] Composition patterns working
- [ ] Examples and documentation complete
