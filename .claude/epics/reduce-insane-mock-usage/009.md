# Establish test builder patterns for common entities

## Description

Create reusable entity builders and patterns that generate realistic test data without relying on mocks. These builders will provide consistent, flexible ways to create test entities with proper relationships and realistic data, supporting both simple and complex test scenarios.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Builder pattern implementation for common domain entities
- [ ] Realistic default values with ability to override specific fields
- [ ] Support for entity relationships and foreign key constraints
- [ ] Fluent API for easy customization and chaining
- [ ] Integration with database utilities for persistent entities
- [ ] Performance optimization for bulk entity creation
- [ ] Type safety and TypeScript integration
- [ ] Extensible pattern for adding new entity types

## Technical Details

### Builder Pattern Structure
```typescript
// tests/fixtures/builders/user.builder.ts
export class UserBuilder {
  static create(): UserBuilder
  withId(id: string): UserBuilder
  withEmail(email: string): UserBuilder
  withRole(role: Role): UserBuilder
  build(): User
  buildMany(count: number): User[]
  persist(): Promise<User>
  persistMany(count: number): Promise<User[]>
}
```

### Entity Categories
1. **User Entities**: Users, roles, permissions, profiles
2. **Content Entities**: Posts, comments, documents, media
3. **Business Entities**: Orders, products, transactions, invoices
4. **System Entities**: Configurations, logs, notifications, sessions
5. **Relationship Entities**: Many-to-many associations, hierarchies

### Builder Features
- **Sensible Defaults**: Realistic default values for all fields
- **Fluent Interface**: Chainable methods for easy customization
- **Relationship Handling**: Automatic creation of related entities
- **Data Consistency**: Ensures valid relationships and constraints
- **Bulk Operations**: Efficient creation of multiple entities
- **Persistence Integration**: Direct database persistence capabilities

### Realistic Data Generation
- **Faker Integration**: Use faker.js or similar for realistic fake data
- **Deterministic Output**: Seeded generation for consistent test runs
- **Localization Support**: Generate data appropriate for different locales
- **Business Logic**: Respect domain rules and constraints
- **Edge Cases**: Builders for boundary conditions and error scenarios

### Relationship Management
```typescript
// Example of relationship handling
const user = await UserBuilder.create()
  .withRole('admin')
  .persist()

const posts = await PostBuilder.create()
  .withAuthor(user)
  .buildMany(5)
  .persistMany()
```

### Performance Considerations
- Lazy loading of related entities
- Bulk insert optimization for database persistence
- Memory-efficient builders for large test datasets
- Caching of commonly used entity patterns
- Transaction-based bulk operations

### Type Safety and Integration
- Full TypeScript support with proper type inference
- Integration with existing domain models
- Validation of builder constraints at compile time
- Auto-completion support for builder methods
- Type-safe relationship definitions

### Extensibility Pattern
- Base builder class for common functionality
- Plugin system for custom field generators
- Template system for common entity patterns
- Configuration-driven builder generation
- Dynamic builder creation for new entity types

## Dependencies

- **Task 002**: Requires shared fixtures directory structure
- **Faker Library**: For realistic data generation
- **Domain Models**: Integration with existing entity definitions

## Effort Estimate

**Size**: Medium (2 days)
- Day 1: Implement base builder pattern and core entity builders
- Day 2: Add relationship handling, performance optimization, and documentation

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Builder patterns are implemented for all common entities
- [ ] Realistic default data is generated consistently
- [ ] Entity relationships are properly managed and created
- [ ] Performance is optimized for both single and bulk operations
- [ ] Type safety is maintained throughout the builder API
- [ ] Integration with database utilities works seamlessly
- [ ] Documentation provides clear usage examples and patterns
- [ ] Extensibility allows easy addition of new entity types
