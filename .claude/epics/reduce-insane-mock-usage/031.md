# Implement CI controls with mock density monitoring

## Description

Implement comprehensive CI controls that monitor mock usage density and enforce
quality gates. This includes integration with the existing CI pipeline to track
mock counts, density metrics, and provide automated feedback on pull requests
that introduce excessive mocking.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] CI pipeline tracks mock count per test file
- [ ] Mock density thresholds enforced (max 2 mocks per test)
- [ ] Automated PR comments for mock usage violations
- [ ] Dashboard displaying mock usage trends over time
- [ ] Integration with existing quality-check pipeline
- [ ] Failure conditions for excessive mock usage increases
- [ ] Historical tracking of mock reduction progress

## Technical Details

### Implementation Components

1. **Mock Detection Pipeline**
   - Extend quality-check to analyze mock usage patterns
   - Parse test files for mock creation patterns
   - Calculate density metrics per file and test suite

2. **CI Integration**
   - GitHub Actions workflow modifications
   - PR status checks for mock compliance
   - Automated comments with violation details

3. **Metrics Collection**
   - Mock count trending over time
   - Density heat maps by file/directory
   - Integration with existing monitoring

4. **Quality Gates**
   - Fail builds exceeding thresholds
   - Warning levels for approaching limits
   - Exception handling for legacy code

### Configuration

```yaml
# .github/workflows/mock-monitoring.yml
mockDensity:
  maxMocksPerTest: 2
  maxDensityIncrease: 10%
  exemptPatterns:
    - 'legacy/**'
    - '*.integration.test.ts'
```

## Dependencies

- Task 020: Real implementation patterns established
- Task 030: Quality gates and thresholds defined
- Existing quality-check infrastructure
- GitHub Actions CI pipeline

## Effort Estimate

**Size**: Medium (2 days)

**Breakdown**:

- Mock detection logic: 6 hours
- CI pipeline integration: 4 hours
- Dashboard/reporting: 4 hours
- Testing and validation: 2 hours

## Definition of Done

- [ ] CI pipeline automatically detects mock usage patterns
- [ ] PRs blocked when exceeding density thresholds
- [ ] Team receives automated feedback on mock usage
- [ ] Metrics dashboard operational and accessible
- [ ] Integration tests validate all monitoring features
- [ ] Documentation updated for CI configuration
- [ ] Zero false positives in mock detection
- [ ] Performance impact on CI pipeline < 30 seconds
