# Task: Consolidate repetitive mock patterns into factories

## Description

Identify and consolidate repetitive mock patterns throughout the test suite into
reusable factory functions. This reduces duplication while preparing for
eventual elimination of remaining mocks through systematic refactoring.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Repetitive mock patterns identified and documented
- [ ] Mock factory functions created for common patterns
- [ ] Duplicated mock code replaced with factory calls
- [ ] Factory functions designed for easy future elimination
- [ ] Significant reduction in mock code duplication

## Technical Details

- Analyze test files for repeated mock setup patterns
- Create factory functions for common mock configurations
- Replace duplicated mock code with factory function calls
- Design factories to be easily replaceable with real implementations
- Document factory usage and migration path to real implementations

## Dependencies

- [ ] Mock usage audit completed (task 011)
- [ ] Understanding of common mock patterns
- [ ] Test utility infrastructure in place

## Effort Estimate

- Size: Large
- Hours: 6-8 hours
- Parallel: true

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Repetitive mock patterns eliminated
- [ ] Factory functions implemented and tested
- [ ] Significant reduction in duplicate mock code
- [ ] Clear migration path documented
- [ ] Factory functions ready for future elimination
