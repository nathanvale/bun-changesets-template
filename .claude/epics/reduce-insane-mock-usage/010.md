# Document new test organization guidelines

## Description

Create comprehensive documentation for the new test organization structure, patterns, and guidelines. This documentation will serve as the definitive guide for writing tests without excessive mocking, ensuring consistent adoption across the team and future development.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Complete testing strategy documentation
- [ ] Test tier organization and usage guidelines
- [ ] Testing utilities and fixture usage examples
- [ ] Migration guide from existing mock-heavy tests
- [ ] Best practices and anti-patterns documentation
- [ ] Code examples and templates for common scenarios
- [ ] Troubleshooting guide for common issues
- [ ] Team onboarding documentation

## Technical Details

```

### Key Documentation Topics
1. **Testing Philosophy**: Why we avoid excessive mocking
2. **Test Organization**: How to structure tests across tiers
3. **Utility Usage**: When and how to use each testing utility
4. **Migration Strategy**: Step-by-step guide for converting existing tests
5. **Performance Guidelines**: Optimizing test execution time
6. **Debugging Techniques**: How to debug failing tests effectively

### Migration Guide Content
- Identifying mock-heavy tests that need conversion
- Step-by-step conversion process for different test types
- Common pitfalls and how to avoid them
- Performance considerations during migration
- Validation strategies for converted tests
- Timeline and prioritization recommendations

### Best Practices Documentation
- When to use each test tier (unit vs integration vs e2e)
- How to structure test data and scenarios
- Resource cleanup patterns and requirements
- Test naming conventions and organization
- Error handling and assertion strategies
- Performance optimization techniques

### Code Examples and Templates
```typescript
// Example: Unit test template
describe('UserService', () => {
  let userService: UserService
  let testDb: TestDatabase

  beforeEach(async () => {
    testDb = await TestDatabase.create()
    userService = new UserService(testDb.connection)
  })

  afterEach(async () => {
    await testDb.cleanup()
  })
})
```

### Troubleshooting Guide
- Test flakiness diagnosis and resolution
- Resource leak detection and prevention
- Performance bottleneck identification
- Common configuration issues
- Debugging test failures in CI/CD
- Integration problems with existing code

### Team Onboarding Content
- Quick start guide for new team members
- Testing workflow and development process
- Tool setup and configuration
- Code review checklist for tests
- Common questions and answers
- Training materials and resources

## Dependencies

All foundation tasks must be complete to provide accurate documentation:
- **Task 001**: Test tier directory structure
- **Task 002**: Shared fixtures directory structure
- **Task 003**: MSW server setup and configuration
- **Task 004**: Test database utilities
- **Task 005**: Temporary file system utilities
- **Task 006**: Fake time/random utilities
- **Task 007**: Vitest configuration updates
- **Task 008**: Global test cleanup mechanisms
- **Task 009**: Test builder patterns

## Effort Estimate

**Size**: Small (1 day)
- Morning: Create documentation structure and core content
- Afternoon: Add examples, troubleshooting, and migration guide
