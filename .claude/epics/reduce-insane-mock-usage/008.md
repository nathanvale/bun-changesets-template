# Task: Create global test cleanup mechanisms

## Description

Implement comprehensive global cleanup mechanisms that ensure all test utilities
are properly reset between tests. This prevents test pollution and ensures
reliable, isolated test execution.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Global cleanup registry for all test utilities
- [ ] Automatic cleanup between individual tests
- [ ] Cleanup verification and error handling
- [ ] Performance monitoring for cleanup operations
- [ ] Graceful handling of cleanup failures

## Technical Details

- Create centralized cleanup registry system
- Implement automatic cleanup hooks with test lifecycle
- Set up cleanup verification and health checks
- Monitor cleanup performance and timing
- Handle cleanup failures gracefully without breaking tests

## Dependencies

- [ ] Updated Vitest configuration (task 007)
- [ ] All test utilities integrated
- [ ] Understanding of test lifecycle requirements

## Effort Estimate

- Size: Medium
- Hours: 3-4 hours
- Parallel: false (depends on Vitest integration)

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Global cleanup system functional
- [ ] Automatic cleanup between tests verified
- [ ] Cleanup error handling working
- [ ] Performance monitoring in place
- [ ] System tested with multiple test scenarios
