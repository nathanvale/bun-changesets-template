# Create global test cleanup mechanisms

## Description

Implement comprehensive global test cleanup mechanisms that provide a
zero-zombie guarantee by tracking all test resources and ensuring complete
cleanup regardless of how tests terminate. This builds on the Vitest
configuration to create bulletproof resource management.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Global resource registry tracks all test-created resources
- [ ] Automatic cleanup registration when resources are created
- [ ] Forced cleanup on process termination (SIGINT, SIGTERM)
- [ ] Cleanup verification and reporting mechanisms
- [ ] Resource leak detection and alerting
- [ ] Cleanup timeout handling to prevent hanging
- [ ] Zero-zombie guarantee across all test scenarios
- [ ] Performance monitoring for cleanup operations

## Technical Details

### Global Cleanup Architecture

```typescript
// tests/fixtures/cleanup/registry.ts
export class GlobalCleanupRegistry {
  register(resource: CleanableResource): void
  unregister(resource: CleanableResource): void
  cleanupAll(): Promise<void>
  forceCleanup(): void
  getActiveResources(): CleanableResource[]
}

interface CleanableResource {
  id: string
  type: 'database' | 'server' | 'file' | 'timer' | 'other'
  cleanup(): Promise<void>
  forceCleanup?(): void
}
```

### Resource Tracking Components

1. **Resource Registry**: Central tracking of all test resources
2. **Cleanup Scheduler**: Manages cleanup order and dependencies
3. **Force Cleanup**: Emergency cleanup for process termination
4. **Leak Detector**: Identifies resources that weren't cleaned up
5. **Cleanup Reporter**: Provides detailed cleanup status and timing
6. **Process Handler**: Handles SIGINT/SIGTERM for graceful shutdown

### Cleanup Strategies

- **Graceful Cleanup**: Normal cleanup with proper async handling
- **Forced Cleanup**: Synchronous cleanup for emergency situations
- **Timeout Cleanup**: Cleanup with timeouts to prevent hanging
- **Parallel Cleanup**: Cleanup independent resources concurrently
- **Dependent Cleanup**: Respect cleanup order for dependent resources

### Zero-Zombie Guarantee Implementation

- All resources auto-register themselves when created
- Process exit handlers ensure cleanup on unexpected termination
- Cleanup verification confirms all resources were properly released
- Resource leak detection alerts on incomplete cleanup
- Fallback mechanisms for cleanup failures

### Performance Optimization

- Cleanup batching for similar resource types
- Parallel cleanup where dependencies allow
- Cleanup caching to avoid redundant operations
- Resource pooling for frequently created/destroyed resources
- Memory usage monitoring during cleanup

### Error Handling and Reporting

- Cleanup error aggregation and reporting
- Detailed logging for debugging cleanup issues
- Resource-specific error handling strategies
- Cleanup retry mechanisms for transient failures
- Performance metrics for cleanup operations

### Integration Points

- Process signal handlers (SIGINT, SIGTERM, SIGHUP)
- Vitest lifecycle hooks (beforeAll, afterAll, etc.)
- Test framework error handling
- CI/CD pipeline integration for cleanup verification
- Development environment cleanup monitoring

## Dependencies

- **Task 007**: Requires updated Vitest configuration with proper teardown
- **Process Handlers**: Signal handling for graceful shutdown
- **Resource Tracking**: Integration with all testing utilities

## Effort Estimate

**Size**: Medium (2 days)

- Day 1: Implement global cleanup registry and resource tracking
- Day 2: Add forced cleanup, leak detection, and performance optimization

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Global cleanup registry tracks all test resources automatically
- [ ] Zero-zombie guarantee is verified across all test scenarios
- [ ] Process termination triggers complete resource cleanup
- [ ] Cleanup performance is optimized and monitored
- [ ] Resource leaks are detected and reported
- [ ] Error handling ensures cleanup continues despite failures
- [ ] Integration with CI/CD verifies cleanup completeness
- [ ] Documentation provides clear patterns for resource management
