## Objective

Implement automated systems to enforce promotion rules that prevent code with
excessive mock usage from advancing through deployment pipeline.

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Automated promotion gates implemented
- [ ] Integration with deployment pipeline
- [ ] Clear violation reporting and blocking
- [ ] Exception handling and override mechanisms
- [ ] Audit trail for all promotion decisions

## Technical Requirements

- Integrate with CI/CD deployment pipeline
- Implement rule evaluation engine
- Create violation reporting system
- Set up override and exception workflows
- Establish audit logging and monitoring

## Acceptance Criteria

- Code cannot be promoted with mock violations
- Clear feedback provided for blocked promotions
- Emergency override process available
- All decisions logged and auditable
- Minimal impact on legitimate deployments

## Implementation Notes

- Leverage mock density monitoring from Task 051
- Implement graduated enforcement (warning â†’ block)
- Create clear escalation procedures
- Provide detailed violation reports
- Integrate with existing deployment tools

## Dependencies

- Task 029: Integration test migration from mock-heavy patterns
- Task 051: CI controls with mock density monitoring

## Risks

- Blocking legitimate deployments
- Complex exception handling scenarios
- Performance impact on deployment pipeline
