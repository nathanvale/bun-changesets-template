## Objective

Establish comprehensive integration test patterns that validate complete
service-to-repository-to-database flows without mocking internal boundaries,
ensuring end-to-end business logic correctness.

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Integration test patterns defined for all service layers
- [ ] Complete flows tested from service entry points to database
- [ ] Transaction boundaries properly tested
- [ ] Error propagation validated through all layers
- [ ] Performance benchmarks established for integration tests
- [ ] Test data management patterns implemented

## Tasks

1. **Design integration test architecture**
   - Define test boundaries and scope for integration tests
   - Establish naming conventions for integration test files
   - Create test organization patterns by business domain

2. **Implement service layer integration tests**
   - Test complete business workflows from service entry points
   - Validate data flow through repository layer to database
   - Test transaction handling and rollback scenarios

3. **Create test data management patterns**
   - Implement test data builders for complex business scenarios
   - Create database seeding strategies for integration tests
   - Add test data cleanup and isolation mechanisms

4. **Add error scenario testing**
   - Test error propagation from database through all layers
   - Validate business rule violations and constraint errors
   - Test concurrent access and race condition scenarios

5. **Implement performance monitoring**
   - Add performance benchmarks for integration test suites
   - Monitor memory usage and database connection handling
   - Create performance regression detection for test suites

## Architecture Impact

- Validates complete business logic flows without internal mocking
- Provides confidence in layer interactions and data consistency
- Enables refactoring safety through comprehensive integration coverage
- Establishes patterns for testing complex business scenarios

## Testing Strategy

- SQLite in-memory databases for fast integration testing
- Test isolation through database transactions and cleanup
- Performance monitoring to maintain acceptable test execution times
- Business scenario coverage through realistic test data

## Notes

- Depends on repository adapters and SQLite infrastructure
- Focus on testing business logic flows, not individual layer units
- Balance comprehensive coverage with test execution performance
