# Task 011: Audit current mock usage and categorize by type

## Description

Conduct a comprehensive audit of all 1,963 mocks across 66 files in the codebase
to categorize them by type, purpose, and complexity. This audit will provide the
foundation for targeted mock reduction strategies in subsequent tasks.

The audit will create a detailed inventory that enables data-driven decisions
about which mocks to eliminate, consolidate, or convert to integration tests.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **Complete Mock Inventory**
   - [ ] Catalog all 1,963 mocks across 66 files
   - [ ] Categorize by type: console output, utility functions, external
         services, internal modules, etc.
   - [ ] Identify mock complexity (simple stubs vs complex behavioral mocks)
   - [ ] Document mock dependencies and relationships

2. **Pattern Analysis**
   - [ ] Identify repetitive mock patterns suitable for factory consolidation
   - [ ] Find tests with >2 mocks (candidates for integration test conversion)
   - [ ] Locate unnecessary mocks of internal utility functions
   - [ ] Map external service mocking patterns

3. **Impact Assessment**
   - [ ] Estimate effort required for each category of mock reduction
   - [ ] Identify high-risk changes that require careful coordination
   - [ ] Prioritize mock reduction opportunities by impact/effort ratio

4. **Documentation**
   - [ ] Create structured audit report with categorized findings
   - [ ] Document mock reduction roadmap based on audit results
   - [ ] Provide recommendations for each mock category

## Technical Details

### Audit Categories

1. **Console Output Mocks** (~150 target for elimination)
   - `console.log`, `console.error`, `console.warn` mocks
   - Process output redirection mocks
   - Logging framework mocks

2. **Utility Function Mocks**
   - Path manipulation utilities
   - String processing utilities
   - Internal helper functions

3. **External Service Mocks**
   - File system operations
   - Network requests
   - Third-party API calls

4. **Internal Module Mocks**
   - Domain logic mocking
   - Cross-module dependencies
   - Business logic abstractions

5. **Mock Complexity Analysis**
   - Simple return value stubs
   - Behavioral mocks with multiple scenarios
   - Stateful mocks tracking call history
   - Mocks with complex setup/teardown

### Audit Tools and Methodology

```bash
# Find all test files with mocks
find . -name "*.test.ts" -o -name "*.spec.ts" | xargs grep -l "mock\|spy\|stub"

# Count mock usage patterns
grep -r "vi\.mock\|jest\.mock\|mockImplementation" --include="*.test.ts" --include="*.spec.ts"

# Identify console mocking
grep -r "console\." --include="*.test.ts" --include="*.spec.ts" | grep -E "mock|spy|stub"

# Find utility function mocks
grep -r "mockImplementation\|mockReturnValue" --include="*.test.ts" --include="*.spec.ts"
```

### Analysis Framework

1. **Quantitative Analysis**
   - Mock count per file
   - Mock complexity scoring
   - Test-to-mock ratio analysis
   - Dependency depth measurement

2. **Qualitative Analysis**
   - Mock necessity assessment
   - Integration test conversion candidates
   - Consolidation opportunities
   - Risk factor evaluation

## Dependencies

- **Task 010**: Mock measurement and tracking infrastructure must be established
- **Parallel Execution**: Can run independently once measurement tools are
  available

## Effort Estimate

**Size**: Large (3 days)

**Breakdown**:

- Day 1: Automated scanning and initial categorization
- Day 2: Manual analysis and pattern identification
- Day 3: Documentation and recommendations

**Skills Required**:

- Test analysis expertise
- Pattern recognition
- Documentation skills
- Codebase familiarity

## Definition of Done

1. **Comprehensive Audit Report**
   - Complete inventory of all 1,963 mocks
   - Detailed categorization with counts and examples
   - Pattern analysis with consolidation opportunities
   - Risk assessment for each category

2. **Actionable Recommendations**
   - Prioritized mock reduction roadmap
   - Specific targets for subsequent tasks
   - Effort estimates for each reduction category
   - Integration test conversion candidates

3. **Supporting Documentation**
   - Mock pattern examples
   - Consolidation factory proposals
   - Risk mitigation strategies
   - Success metrics definition

4. **Tool Integration**
   - Audit results integrated with tracking tools from Task 010
   - Baseline measurements established
   - Progress tracking mechanisms in place

The audit must provide sufficient detail and analysis to drive informed
decisions in all subsequent mock reduction tasks, ensuring maximum impact with
minimal risk.
