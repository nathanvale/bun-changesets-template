# Task: Audit current mock usage and categorize by type

## Description

Conduct a comprehensive audit of all current mock usage across the codebase.
Categorize mocks by type, usage pattern, and complexity to inform targeted
elimination strategies and prioritize high-impact reductions.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Complete inventory of all mock usage patterns
- [ ] Categorization by mock type (console, utilities, dependencies, etc.)
- [ ] Usage frequency analysis and hotspot identification
- [ ] Complexity assessment for each mock category
- [ ] Elimination strategy recommendations per category

## Technical Details

- Scan all test files for mock imports and usage patterns
- Categorize mocks: console output, utility functions, external dependencies,
  modules
- Count mock usage frequency and identify heavily mocked components
- Assess complexity of eliminating each mock category
- Document patterns that can be eliminated vs. those requiring replacement

## Dependencies

- [ ] New test organization guidelines (task 010)
- [ ] Access to all legacy test files
- [ ] Code analysis tools and scripts

## Effort Estimate

- Size: Large
- Hours: 8-10 hours
- Parallel: true

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Complete mock usage inventory created
- [ ] Clear categorization system established
- [ ] Usage frequency analysis complete
- [ ] Elimination strategies documented
- [ ] Priority elimination targets identified
