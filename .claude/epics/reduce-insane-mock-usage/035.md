# Establish metrics tracking for mock creep prevention

## Description

Implement comprehensive metrics tracking and alerting system to prevent mock
creep and regression to old patterns. This includes long-term monitoring, trend
analysis, and proactive alerting to maintain the gains achieved during the epic.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Dashboard tracking mock usage trends over time
- [ ] Automated alerts for mock density increases
- [ ] Weekly/monthly reporting on test health metrics
- [ ] Integration with existing monitoring infrastructure
- [ ] Predictive analytics for mock creep detection
- [ ] Team visibility into testing pattern adherence
- [ ] Historical baseline preservation for comparison

## Technical Details

### Metrics Collection

1. **Core Metrics**
   - Mock count per test file
   - Mock density trends over time
   - Real implementation adoption rate
   - Test reliability improvements

2. **Advanced Analytics**
   - Prediction models for mock creep
   - Correlation analysis (mocks vs test flakiness)
   - Team/feature area breakdowns
   - Code review compliance rates

3. **Alert Thresholds**
   - 10% increase in mock density (warning)
   - 25% increase in mock density (critical)
   - New files with >2 mocks per test
   - Regression to deprecated patterns

### Implementation Components

```typescript
// Metrics collection service
interface MetricsCollector {
  collectMockUsageMetrics(): MockMetrics
  analyzeTrends(timeRange: TimeRange): TrendAnalysis
  generateAlerts(): Alert[]
  createReport(period: ReportPeriod): HealthReport
}

// Dashboard configuration
interface MetricsDashboard {
  realTimeMetrics: MockDensityWidget
  trendAnalysis: TrendChartWidget
  alertsPanel: AlertsWidget
  teamScorecard: TeamMetricsWidget
}
```

### Monitoring Infrastructure

- **Data Collection**: Automated parsing during CI runs
- **Storage**: Time-series database for trend analysis
- **Visualization**: Grafana dashboards or similar
- **Alerting**: Slack/email notifications for thresholds
- **Reporting**: Automated weekly summaries

## Dependencies

- Task 019: Migration tracking and validation completed
- Task 031: CI controls and monitoring infrastructure
- Existing monitoring and alerting systems
- Team communication channels (Slack, email)

## Effort Estimate

**Size**: Medium (2 days)

**Breakdown**:

- Metrics collection setup: 5 hours
- Dashboard creation: 4 hours
- Alerting configuration: 3 hours
- Validation and testing: 4 hours

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Comprehensive metrics dashboard operational
- [ ] Automated alerts configured and tested
- [ ] Team receives regular health reports
- [ ] Trend analysis identifies patterns accurately
- [ ] Alerting prevents mock creep before it spreads
- [ ] Historical data preserved for long-term analysis
- [ ] Integration with existing tools seamless
- [ ] Zero false positive alerts disrupting workflow
