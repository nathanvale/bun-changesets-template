# Task: Remove utility function mocking (path, string utils)

## Description

Eliminate mocking of utility functions like path manipulation, string utilities,
and other deterministic helper functions. Replace with real implementations and
proper test data setup to ensure tests verify actual behavior.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] All path utility mocks removed (path.join, path.resolve, etc.)
- [ ] String utility function mocks eliminated
- [ ] Math and date utility mocks removed where appropriate
- [ ] Real implementations used with proper test data
- [ ] Test functionality maintained through proper setup

## Technical Details

- Remove mocks for Node.js path utilities
- Eliminate string manipulation function mocks
- Replace with real implementations using controlled test data
- Set up proper file system structures for path testing
- Use real string operations with known test inputs

## Dependencies

- [ ] Mock usage audit completed (task 011)
- [ ] Temporary file system utilities (task 005)
- [ ] Understanding of utility function usage patterns

## Effort Estimate

- Size: Medium
- Hours: 4-6 hours
- Parallel: true

## Definition of Done

- [ ] All utility function mocks removed
- [ ] Real implementations working in tests
- [ ] Proper test data setup established
- [ ] No test functionality lost
- [ ] Utility mock reduction documented
