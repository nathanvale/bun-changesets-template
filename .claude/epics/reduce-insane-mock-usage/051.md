## Objective

Implement comprehensive CI controls that monitor mock density and prevent
regression to excessive mock usage patterns.

## Success Criteria

- [ ] CI pipeline includes mock density checks
- [ ] Automated warnings for files exceeding mock thresholds
- [ ] Build fails for critical mock density violations
- [ ] Integration with existing quality-check pipeline
- [ ] Metrics collection for ongoing monitoring

## Technical Requirements

- Add mock density analysis to quality-check package
- Integrate with existing CI/CD pipeline
- Configure thresholds and violation rules
- Implement automated reporting
- Set up alerting for trend monitoring

## Acceptance Criteria

- Mock density is checked on every PR
- Clear feedback provided for violations
- Emergency override mechanism available
- Historical trend tracking enabled
- Documentation for threshold tuning

## Implementation Notes

- Leverage existing quality-check infrastructure
- Use AST parsing for accurate mock detection
- Consider file size normalization for density calculation
- Implement graduated response (warning → error → fail)
- Store metrics for trend analysis

## Dependencies

- Task 020: Mock usage analysis and cleanup
- Task 050: Implementation guidance and standards

## Risks

- Performance impact on CI pipeline
- False positives from legitimate mock usage
- Threshold calibration challenges
