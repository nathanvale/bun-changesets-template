# Task 045: Refactor valuable but over-mocked tests

## Overview

Comprehensive refactoring of tests that provide business value but suffer from
excessive mocking, transforming them into reliable, maintainable tests.

## Context

- Part of Phase 4: Legacy Test Migration & Refactoring
- Addresses the most challenging migration cases
- Critical for preserving test coverage while improving quality

## Objectives

- Identify tests with high business value but excessive mocking
- Refactor mock-heavy tests to use real implementations
- Maintain test intent while improving reliability
- Establish patterns for mock reduction in complex scenarios
- Ensure refactored tests are more maintainable

## Tasks

- [ ] Prioritize over-mocked tests by business value
- [ ] Analyze mock dependencies and identify reduction opportunities
- [ ] Design real service integration strategies for complex tests
- [ ] Refactor tests incrementally to maintain stability
- [ ] Replace complex mock chains with real implementations
- [ ] Implement proper test isolation for refactored tests
- [ ] Update test assertions to match real behavior
- [ ] Validate test coverage is maintained or improved
- [ ] Document refactoring patterns and lessons learned
- [ ] Create guidelines for preventing mock overuse

## Success Criteria

- All identified over-mocked tests successfully refactored
- Significant mock reduction (70%+ fewer mocks per test)
- Tests maintain or improve coverage and reliability
- Clear patterns established for mock reduction
- Comprehensive documentation of refactoring approaches

## Dependencies

- depends_on: [043] (Integration test migration)
