# Set up shared fixtures directory structure

## Description

Create a comprehensive shared fixtures directory structure to house reusable
test utilities, builders, mock servers, and cleanup mechanisms. This foundation
will enable consistent, reliable testing across all test tiers without excessive
mocking.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Create `tests/fixtures/` root directory
- [ ] Create `tests/fixtures/builders/` for entity builders
- [ ] Create `tests/fixtures/servers/` for mock server configurations
- [ ] Create `tests/fixtures/env/` for environment utilities
- [ ] Create `tests/fixtures/fs/` for file system utilities
- [ ] Create `tests/fixtures/cleanup/` for resource cleanup utilities
- [ ] Each directory has proper TypeScript configuration
- [ ] Index files export utilities from each subdirectory

## Technical Details

### Directory Structure

```
tests/fixtures/
├── builders/       # Entity builders and factories
│   ├── index.ts
│   └── README.md
├── servers/        # Mock server setups (MSW, test servers)
│   ├── index.ts
│   └── README.md
├── env/           # Environment and configuration utilities
│   ├── index.ts
│   └── README.md
├── fs/            # File system testing utilities
│   ├── index.ts
│   └── README.md
├── cleanup/       # Resource cleanup and teardown
│   ├── index.ts
│   └── README.md
└── index.ts       # Main exports
```

### Implementation Approach

- Each subdirectory will have its own TypeScript configuration
- Utilities will be exported through index files for easy importing
- README files will document usage patterns and conventions
- Type definitions will be co-located with implementations

### Code Organization Principles

- Single responsibility per utility
- Clear separation between different types of fixtures
- Composable and reusable components
- Zero dependencies between fixture types initially

## Dependencies

None - this is a foundational infrastructure task.

## Effort Estimate

**Size**: Medium (2 days)

- Day 1: Create directory structure and basic index files
- Day 2: Set up TypeScript configuration and documentation templates

## Definition of Done

- [ ] All fixture directories exist with proper structure
- [ ] TypeScript configuration allows clean imports
- [ ] Index files properly export from subdirectories
- [ ] Documentation templates are in place
- [ ] Structure supports parallel development of different fixture types
- [ ] No circular dependencies between fixture categories
