# Task: Set up shared fixtures directory structure

## Description

Create a comprehensive shared fixtures system that provides reusable test data,
builders, and utilities across all test tiers. This reduces duplication and
ensures consistent test data patterns.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] test/fixtures/data directory for static test data
- [ ] test/fixtures/builders directory for object builders
- [ ] test/fixtures/factories directory for entity factories
- [ ] test/fixtures/templates directory for common templates
- [ ] Shared fixture loading and management utilities

## Technical Details

- Implement TypeScript-first fixture definitions
- Create builder pattern utilities for complex objects
- Set up fixture inheritance and composition patterns
- Establish naming conventions for fixture files
- Implement lazy loading for performance optimization

## Dependencies

- [ ] Test tier directories created (task 001)
- [ ] Understanding of common test data patterns
- [ ] TypeScript configuration for shared imports

## Effort Estimate

- Size: Medium
- Hours: 4-5 hours
- Parallel: true

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Complete fixtures directory structure
- [ ] Builder pattern utilities implemented
- [ ] Fixture loading system functional
- [ ] Documentation for fixture usage
- [ ] Examples created for common patterns
