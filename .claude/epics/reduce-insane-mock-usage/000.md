# Task: Audit existing test locations across monorepo and packages

## Description

Audit and document all existing test file locations across the monorepo
structure, including root-level tests and tests in individual packages. This
comprehensive audit will form the foundation for the safe migration to the
legacy folder structure.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] All test files identified across monorepo
- [ ] Documentation created showing test distribution
- [ ] Test types categorized (unit, integration, e2e)
- [ ] Mock usage patterns documented per test location
- [ ] Report generated with migration recommendations

## Technical Details

- Search patterns: `**/*.test.ts`, `**/*.spec.ts`, `**/__tests__/**`
- Document test framework usage (Vitest, Jest, etc.)
- Note mock import patterns and dependencies
- Identify tests with >2 mocks for later promotion
- Map test coverage to source files

## Dependencies

- [ ] Access to all repository directories
- [ ] Vitest configuration understanding

## Effort Estimate

- Size: Small
- Hours: 4-6 hours
- Parallel: true

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Complete test inventory created
- [ ] Test categorization documented
- [ ] Migration strategy outlined
- [ ] Team review completed
- [ ] Report checked into repository
