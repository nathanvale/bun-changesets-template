# Task 000: Audit existing test locations across monorepo and packages

## Description

Perform a comprehensive audit of all existing test files and directories across
the entire monorepo to understand the current test structure, identify patterns,
and document all test locations before beginning the legacy migration process.

This audit will provide the foundation for the safe migration of existing tests
to test-legacy folders and inform the design of the new test tier structure.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **Complete inventory of test files**
   - [ ] All test files identified across root and packages
   - [ ] Test file patterns documented (_.test._, _.spec._, **tests**, etc.)
   - [ ] Test directory structures mapped

2. **Package-level test analysis**
   - [ ] Each package's test setup documented
   - [ ] Test configuration files identified (vitest.config._, jest.config._,
         etc.)
   - [ ] Test dependencies and tooling catalogued

3. **Test categorization**
   - [ ] Unit tests identified and categorized
   - [ ] Integration tests identified and categorized
   - [ ] E2E tests identified and categorized
   - [ ] Mock usage patterns documented

4. **Documentation deliverables**
   - [ ] Audit report created with findings
   - [ ] Migration plan recommendations
   - [ ] Risk assessment for test preservation

## Technical Details

### Audit Scope

- **Root level**: All test files in monorepo root
- **Packages**: All packages in `packages/` directory
- **Configuration**: Test runner configs, setup files, helper utilities
- **Dependencies**: Test-related dependencies in package.json files

### Key Areas to Investigate

1. **File Patterns**

   ```
   *.test.ts, *.test.js
   *.spec.ts, *.spec.js
   __tests__/ directories
   test/ directories
   tests/ directories
   ```

2. **Configuration Files**

   ```
   vitest.config.*
   jest.config.*
   setupTests.*
   test-setup.*
   ```

3. **Mock Patterns**
   - Jest mocks (`__mocks__/` directories)
   - Manual mocks (vi.mock, jest.mock)
   - Module mocking patterns
   - Service mocking implementations

### Tools and Methods

- Use `find` commands to locate test files
- Use `grep` to identify mock usage patterns
- Analyze package.json files for test scripts and dependencies
- Document directory structures and naming conventions

## Dependencies

None - This is the foundational task for the legacy migration phase.

## Effort Estimate

**Size**: Small **Duration**: 1 day **Complexity**: Low to Medium

### Time Breakdown

- Test file discovery and cataloging: 4 hours
- Mock pattern analysis: 2 hours
- Documentation and reporting: 2 hours

## Definition of Done

1. **Comprehensive audit report created** containing:
   - Complete inventory of all test files across monorepo
   - Package-by-package breakdown of test structures
   - Mock usage patterns and anti-patterns identified
   - Test configuration documentation

2. **Migration readiness assessment** including:
   - Risk evaluation for each package's test migration
   - Recommendations for preservation strategies
   - Identification of critical tests that need special handling

3. **Structured data output** for automation:
   - JSON/YAML file with test file locations
   - Package manifest with test metadata
   - Mock usage statistics and patterns

4. **Quality validation**:
   - All packages verified to have complete test inventories
   - No test files overlooked or miscategorized
   - Mock patterns accurately documented with examples

## Notes

- This audit is critical for ensuring no tests are lost during migration
- Pay special attention to edge cases like symbolic links, nested test
  directories
- Document any unusual test patterns or configurations that might complicate
  migration
- Consider test execution dependencies and cross-package test relationships
