# Complete team training materials and sessions

## Description

Develop and deliver comprehensive training materials and sessions to ensure team-wide adoption of new testing patterns. This includes creating interactive workshops, documentation, examples, and hands-on exercises that demonstrate the migration from mock-heavy to real implementation patterns.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Interactive workshop materials covering all new patterns
- [ ] Hands-on exercises with real codebase examples
- [ ] Video recordings for asynchronous learning
- [ ] Quick reference guides for daily use
- [ ] Team training sessions completed (100% attendance)
- [ ] Post-training assessment and feedback collection
- [ ] Ongoing support materials and resources

## Technical Details

### Training Content Structure

1. **Core Concepts Module**
   - Problems with excessive mocking
   - Benefits of real implementations
   - When mocks are still appropriate

2. **Practical Patterns Module**
   - Real service implementations
   - In-memory alternatives
   - Integration test strategies
   - Migration techniques

3. **Hands-on Workshop**
   - Live coding exercises
   - Refactoring mock-heavy tests
   - Code review simulations

4. **Tool Integration**
   - CI enforcement understanding
   - Quality gate navigation
   - Troubleshooting common issues

### Training Materials

```markdown
# Workshop Agenda (4 hours)

## Session 1: Understanding the Problem (1 hour)
- Mock proliferation issues
- Impact on test reliability
- Case studies from codebase

## Session 2: New Patterns (1.5 hours)
- Real implementation strategies
- Service pattern examples
- Migration techniques

## Session 3: Hands-on Practice (1 hour)
- Live refactoring exercise
- Pair programming session
- Q&A and troubleshooting

## Session 4: Tools and Process (30 minutes)
- CI integration walkthrough
- Code review guidelines
- Ongoing support resources
```

### Delivery Methods

- **Live Interactive Sessions**: Hands-on workshops with immediate feedback
- **Recorded Content**: Asynchronous learning for different schedules
- **Documentation Hub**: Centralized resource with searchable content
- **Office Hours**: Regular Q&A sessions for ongoing support

## Dependencies

- Task 010: Testing infrastructure migration completed
- Task 028: Quality gates and enforcement ready
- Task 029: Real implementation patterns documented
- Existing team development workflows

## Effort Estimate

**Size**: Medium (2 days)

**Breakdown**:
- Content creation: 6 hours
- Workshop preparation: 4 hours
- Session delivery: 4 hours
- Materials finalization: 2 hours

## Definition of Done
