# Task 021: Implement boundary adapter pattern for external dependencies

## Description

Create adapter interfaces and implementations for external service dependencies
to establish clear trust boundaries in our testing architecture. This pattern
allows us to mock only at the system boundaries while using real implementations
for internal components.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Define adapter interfaces for all external services (email, S3, payment,
      etc.)
- [ ] Implement production adapters for each external service
- [ ] Create adapter registry for dependency injection
- [ ] Establish adapter configuration system
- [ ] Document adapter pattern usage guidelines
- [ ] All adapters follow consistent interface design
- [ ] Type safety maintained across all adapters

## Technical Details

### Adapter Interfaces

- Email service adapter (SendGrid, SES, etc.)
- File storage adapter (S3, local filesystem)
- Payment processing adapter (Stripe, PayPal)
- Authentication adapter (Auth0, Cognito)
- Logging adapter (CloudWatch, DataDog)
- Cache adapter (Redis, in-memory)

### Implementation Structure

```typescript
interface ServiceAdapter<T> {
  connect(): Promise<void>
  disconnect(): Promise<void>
  healthCheck(): Promise<boolean>
  // Service-specific methods
}

interface EmailAdapter extends ServiceAdapter<EmailConfig> {
  sendEmail(to: string, subject: string, body: string): Promise<void>
  sendTemplate(templateId: string, data: object): Promise<void>
}
```

### Configuration System

- Environment-based adapter selection
- Adapter-specific configuration validation
- Runtime adapter switching capability

## Dependencies

- **Task 018**: Mock abstraction framework (provides base patterns)

## Effort Estimate

**Size**: Large (3 days)

**Breakdown**:

- Day 1: Design adapter interfaces and registry system
- Day 2: Implement production adapters for core services
- Day 3: Create configuration system and documentation

## Definition of Done

- [ ] All external service dependencies have adapter interfaces
- [ ] Production adapters implemented and tested
- [ ] Adapter registry enables easy switching between implementations
- [ ] Configuration system supports environment-specific adapters
- [ ] Documentation covers adapter pattern usage
- [ ] Type safety verified for all adapter implementations
- [ ] No direct external service calls remain in business logic
