## Objective

Implement the boundary adapter pattern for all external dependencies to create
clear abstraction layers that enable better testing strategies and reduce
coupling to external services.

## Success Criteria

- [ ] All external HTTP APIs wrapped with adapters
- [ ] Database access abstracted through repository pattern
- [ ] File system operations abstracted through storage adapters
- [ ] Email service abstracted through messaging adapters
- [ ] All adapters follow consistent interface patterns
- [ ] Adapters support both real and fake implementations
- [ ] Clear separation between business logic and external concerns

## Tasks

1. **Design adapter interfaces**
   - Define consistent adapter interface patterns
   - Establish naming conventions for adapters
   - Create base adapter types for common patterns

2. **Implement HTTP service adapters**
   - Wrap all external API calls in adapter classes
   - Create interfaces for each external service
   - Implement real implementations using current HTTP clients

3. **Implement database adapters**
   - Create repository pattern for database access
   - Abstract SQL queries behind repository interfaces
   - Ensure repositories return domain objects, not raw data

4. **Implement storage adapters**
   - Abstract file system operations
   - Create interfaces for file upload/download
   - Support both local and cloud storage backends

5. **Implement messaging adapters**
   - Abstract email sending behind interfaces
   - Create adapters for different email providers
   - Support both real and fake email implementations

## Architecture Impact

- Creates clear boundaries between business logic and external systems
- Enables dependency injection for testing
- Reduces coupling to specific external service implementations
- Provides foundation for fake implementations in tests

## Testing Strategy

- Unit tests for adapter logic
- Integration tests with real external services
- Fake implementations for fast test execution
- Contract tests to ensure adapter consistency

## Notes

- This task establishes the foundation for all subsequent architecture changes
- Focus on consistent interface design across all adapters
- Ensure adapters are thin wrappers, not complex business logic containers
