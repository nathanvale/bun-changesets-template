## Objective

Establish automated systems to quarantine flaky tests and detect hanging
processes that may result from mock cleanup efforts.

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Automated detection of flaky tests
- [ ] Quarantine system for unstable tests
- [ ] Hanging process detection and cleanup
- [ ] Integration with test runner pipeline
- [ ] Automated reporting and alerting

## Technical Requirements

- Implement flake detection algorithms
- Create test quarantine mechanism
- Add hanging process monitoring
- Integrate with existing test infrastructure
- Set up automated cleanup procedures

## Acceptance Criteria

- Flaky tests automatically identified and quarantined
- Hanging processes detected within reasonable timeframe
- Clear reporting of quarantined tests
- Easy process for test rehabilitation
- Minimal impact on development workflow

## Implementation Notes

- Use statistical analysis for flake detection
- Implement timeout-based hanging process detection
- Create isolated environment for quarantined tests
- Provide clear feedback to developers
- Maintain audit trail of quarantine actions

## Dependencies

- Task 050: Implementation guidance and standards

## Risks

- Over-aggressive quarantining of legitimate tests
- Performance impact from monitoring overhead
- Complex edge cases in process detection
