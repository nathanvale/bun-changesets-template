# Task: Apply promotion rules - identify >2 mock tests for conversion

## Description

Apply the promotion rule methodology to identify tests with more than 2 mocks
that should be converted to integration tests. This systematic approach targets
the most heavily mocked tests for conversion to more realistic testing patterns.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] All tests with >2 mocks identified and catalogued
- [ ] Promotion candidates prioritized by business value
- [ ] Conversion strategy documented for each candidate
- [ ] Integration test equivalents planned
- [ ] Mock elimination roadmap created for heavy mock users

## Technical Details

- Scan all tests and count mock usage per test function
- Identify tests with >2 mocks as promotion candidates
- Assess business value and criticality of heavily mocked tests
- Plan integration test conversions with real implementations
- Document conversion strategy and effort estimates

## Dependencies

- [ ] Mock usage audit completed (task 011)
- [ ] Test tier infrastructure available (task 001)
- [ ] Understanding of integration test patterns

## Effort Estimate

- Size: Large
- Hours: 8-10 hours
- Parallel: true

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Complete inventory of >2 mock tests
- [ ] Prioritized conversion candidates identified
- [ ] Conversion strategies documented
- [ ] Integration test plans created
- [ ] Mock elimination roadmap established
