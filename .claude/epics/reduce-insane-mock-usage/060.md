## Objective

Establish robust ongoing monitoring and alerting systems to ensure long-term
sustainability of mock reduction achievements.

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Comprehensive monitoring dashboard operational
- [ ] Automated alerting for regression scenarios
- [ ] Regular reporting and review processes
- [ ] Integration with existing operational tools
- [ ] Handoff to operational support teams

## Technical Requirements

- Configure production monitoring systems
- Set up automated alerting and escalation
- Establish regular reporting schedules
- Integrate with existing operational workflows
- Document operational procedures

## Acceptance Criteria

- Real-time visibility into mock usage trends
- Proactive alerts for concerning patterns
- Regular automated reports to stakeholders
- Clear operational procedures documented
- Smooth handoff to ongoing support teams

## Implementation Notes

- Leverage monitoring infrastructure from Task 055
- Configure appropriate alert thresholds and escalation
- Establish regular review and maintenance schedules
- Create operational runbooks and procedures
- Ensure seamless integration with existing tools

## Dependencies

- Task 055: Metrics tracking for mock creep prevention
- Task 058: Final validation of success criteria achievement

## Risks

- Alert fatigue from too many notifications
- Monitoring system maintenance overhead
- Knowledge transfer gaps during handoff
