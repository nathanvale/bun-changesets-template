# Task: Remove Zombie Management Files

## Description

Delete all 8 zombie management files entirely from the codebase as they are no
longer needed with the new simplified approach.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Delete vitest.force-kill.setup.ts completely
- [ ] Delete vitest.globalSetup.ts completely
- [ ] Delete vitest.globalTeardown.ts completely
- [ ] Delete tests/setup/zombie-prevention.ts completely
- [ ] Delete packages/quality-check/src/process-tracker.ts completely
- [ ] Delete scripts/emergency-cleanup.ts completely
- [ ] Delete scripts/kill-all-zombies.sh completely
- [ ] Delete scripts/detect-zombies.sh completely
- [ ] Verify all files are completely removed from git

## Technical Details

- **Implementation approach**: Use git rm to properly remove files from version
  control
- **Key considerations**:
  - Use git rm instead of regular rm to ensure proper removal
  - Verify files are staged for removal
  - Check for any additional files that might be zombie-management related
- **Code locations/files affected**:
  - `vitest.force-kill.setup.ts`
  - `vitest.globalSetup.ts`
  - `vitest.globalTeardown.ts`
  - `tests/setup/zombie-prevention.ts`
  - `packages/quality-check/src/process-tracker.ts`
  - `scripts/emergency-cleanup.ts`
  - `scripts/kill-all-zombies.sh`
  - `scripts/detect-zombies.sh`

## Dependencies

- [ ] Task 006 completed (new configuration validated)
- [ ] Backup commit exists for rollback safety
- [ ] New system proven to work correctly

## Effort Estimate

- Size: XS
- Hours: 0.5
- Parallel: true (can run while cleaning up other references)

## Definition of Done

- [ ] All 8 target files completely deleted
- [ ] Files removed from git version control (git rm)
- [ ] No remaining zombie management files in repository
- [ ] Git status shows files as deleted/staged for removal
- [ ] File count reduction verified (approaching 1000+ line reduction)
