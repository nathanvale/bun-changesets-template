# Task: Create Backup Commit

## Description

Commit current state as a safety fallback before making any changes to the
zombie management system. This ensures we can rollback if the new approach has
issues.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] All current changes are committed and repository is clean
- [ ] Backup commit created with descriptive message
- [ ] Git tag created for easy rollback reference
- [ ] Verify backup commit includes all zombie management files

## Technical Details

- **Implementation approach**: Git commit with clear backup message and optional
  tag
- **Key considerations**:
  - Ensure working directory is clean before proceeding
  - Use descriptive commit message for easy identification
  - Consider creating a git tag for easier rollback
- **Code locations/files affected**: Entire repository state

## Dependencies

- [ ] Task 001 completed (file inventory)
- [ ] Task 002 completed (dependency mapping)
- [ ] Clean git working directory

## Effort Estimate

- Size: XS
- Hours: 0.5
- Parallel: false (must wait for audit tasks to complete)

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Clean git status (no uncommitted changes)
- [ ] Backup commit created with message: "backup: preserve complex zombie
      management before simplification"
- [ ] Optional git tag created for rollback reference
- [ ] Commit hash documented for reference
- [ ] All zombie management files confirmed in backup commit
