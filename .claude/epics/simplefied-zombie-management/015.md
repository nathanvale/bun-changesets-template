# Task: Performance Benchmarking

## Description

Compare before/after performance metrics to ensure the new simplified approach
maintains or improves performance while preventing zombie processes.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Measure test execution time before/after changes
- [ ] Compare memory usage patterns
- [ ] Benchmark startup time differences
- [ ] Analyze resource utilization changes
- [ ] Document performance comparison results
- [ ] Ensure performance is acceptable or improved

## Technical Details

- **Implementation approach**: Run performance benchmarks comparing old vs new
  system
- **Key considerations**:
  - Use consistent test scenarios for comparison
  - Measure multiple runs for statistical significance
  - Consider different test types (unit, integration)
  - Account for environmental factors
- **Code locations/files affected**: Entire test suite performance

## Dependencies

- [ ] Task 013 completed (all changes implemented)
- [ ] Access to performance benchmarking tools
- [ ] Baseline performance data (if available)

## Effort Estimate

- Size: S
- Hours: 2
- Parallel: true (can run alongside extended testing)

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Test execution time benchmarked and compared
- [ ] Memory usage patterns analyzed
- [ ] Startup time differences documented
- [ ] Resource utilization changes measured
- [ ] Performance comparison report completed
- [ ] Performance acceptable or improved vs baseline
- [ ] Any performance regressions identified and addressed
