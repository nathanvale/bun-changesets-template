# Task: Clean Up Configuration References

## Description

Remove complex configuration references from vitest.config.ts and other config
files that pointed to the old zombie management system.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Remove complex setupFiles array with zombie-prevention.ts references
- [ ] Remove environment-aware poolOptions configuration
- [ ] Remove commented global setup/teardown references
- [ ] Remove aggressive timeout configurations
- [ ] Clean up any zombie-related comments or documentation in config
- [ ] Ensure config file is clean and minimal

## Technical Details

- **Implementation approach**: Edit vitest.config.ts and related configuration
  files
- **Key considerations**:
  - Preserve essential configuration that isn't zombie-related
  - Remove only the complex zombie management parts
  - Ensure new simplified config remains intact
- **Code locations/files affected**:
  - `vitest.config.ts` (primary)
  - Any environment-specific configurations
  - Potentially `tsconfig.json` or other related configs

## Dependencies

- [ ] Task 006 completed (new configuration validated)
- [ ] New simplified config already working
- [ ] Understanding of which config to preserve vs remove

## Effort Estimate

- Size: XS
- Hours: 0.75
- Parallel: true (can run alongside file removal)

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Complex setupFiles array removed from vitest.config.ts
- [ ] Environment-aware poolOptions configuration removed
- [ ] Commented global setup/teardown references removed
- [ ] Aggressive timeout configurations removed
- [ ] Zombie-related comments and documentation removed
- [ ] Configuration file clean and minimal
- [ ] New simplified config preserved and functional
