# Task: Add Debug Tools

## Description

Add hanging process detection for debugging to help identify any remaining
resource leaks or hanging processes without the complex zombie management
system.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Add test:debug-hangs script to package.json
- [ ] Configure hanging process reporter for Vitest
- [ ] Test debug script functionality
- [ ] Document usage of debug tools
- [ ] Ensure tools work with new Vitest configuration

## Technical Details

- **Implementation approach**: Add simple debugging script to package.json
- **Key considerations**:
  - Use built-in Vitest debugging capabilities
  - Keep debugging tools simple and focused
  - Ensure compatibility with new fork-based configuration
- **Code locations/files affected**:
  - `package.json` (scripts section)
  - Possibly Vitest configuration for debugging options

## Dependencies

- [ ] Task 009 completed (package.json scripts cleaned up)
- [ ] New Vitest configuration in place
- [ ] Understanding of Vitest debugging capabilities

## Effort Estimate

- Size: XS
- Hours: 0.5
- Parallel: true (can run alongside documentation tasks)

## Definition of Done

- [ ] test:debug-hangs script added to package.json
- [ ] Hanging process reporter configured properly
- [ ] Debug script tested and functional
- [ ] Usage documentation provided
- [ ] Tools compatible with new fork-based Vitest config
- [ ] Debugging tools simple and focused on actual issues
