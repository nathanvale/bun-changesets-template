# Task: Document Standard Cleanup Patterns

## Description

Create documentation for simple resource cleanup patterns to replace the complex
zombie management system with clear, maintainable patterns that developers can
easily understand and implement.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Document standard beforeEach/afterEach cleanup patterns
- [ ] Provide examples for common resource types (servers, databases, files)
- [ ] Create guidelines for test resource management
- [ ] Add examples to project documentation or CLAUDE.md
- [ ] Ensure patterns are simple and maintainable

## Technical Details

- **Implementation approach**: Create documentation with code examples
- **Key considerations**:
  - Focus on simplicity and clarity
  - Provide practical examples for common use cases
  - Make patterns easy to copy and adapt
  - Ensure compatibility with new Vitest configuration
- **Code locations/files affected**:
  - Documentation files (README, CLAUDE.md, or new docs)
  - Example test files if needed

## Dependencies

- [ ] Task 010 completed (import references cleaned up)
- [ ] Understanding of new simplified patterns needed
- [ ] Knowledge of common resource cleanup scenarios

## Effort Estimate

- Size: S
- Hours: 1
- Parallel: true (can run alongside other pattern implementation)

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Standard cleanup patterns documented with examples
- [ ] Common resource types covered (servers, databases, files)
- [ ] Guidelines for test resource management provided
- [ ] Documentation integrated into project docs
- [ ] Examples are clear, simple, and maintainable
- [ ] Patterns compatible with new Vitest configuration
- [ ] Documentation reviewed for clarity and completeness
