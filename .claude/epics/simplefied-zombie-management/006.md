# Task: Validate New Configuration

## Description

Thoroughly test the new Vitest configuration to ensure it prevents zombie
processes and handles all scenarios properly before removing the old system.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Successful test runs in normal execution mode
- [ ] Successful interruption handling (Ctrl+C scenarios)
- [ ] CI pipeline validation with new configuration
- [ ] Zero zombie processes detected during testing
- [ ] Performance acceptable compared to previous setup
- [ ] Wallaby.js compatibility verified (if applicable)

## Technical Details

- **Implementation approach**: Run comprehensive test scenarios with monitoring
- **Key considerations**:
  - Test both normal and abnormal termination scenarios
  - Monitor system for zombie processes during testing
  - Ensure CI compatibility and performance
  - Validate interruption handling works properly
- **Code locations/files affected**: Entire test suite execution

## Dependencies

- [ ] Task 004 completed (vitest config updated)
- [ ] Task 005 completed (minimal global setup created)
- [ ] Process monitoring tools available
- [ ] CI environment accessible for testing

## Effort Estimate

- Size: S
- Hours: 1
- Parallel: false (must wait for config implementation)

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Normal test execution successful with new config
- [ ] Ctrl+C interruption handling verified (no zombies)
- [ ] CI pipeline runs successfully with new config
- [ ] Process monitoring confirms zero zombie processes
- [ ] Performance benchmarks acceptable
- [ ] Wallaby.js compatibility confirmed (if used)
- [ ] New configuration approved for production use
