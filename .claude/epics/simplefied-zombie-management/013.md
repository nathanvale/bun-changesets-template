# Task: Update Quality-Check Package

## Description

Remove processTracker dependencies from the quality-check package and ensure it
works without zombie management complexity, maintaining its core functionality
while removing the over-engineered process tracking.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Remove or refactor any code importing processTracker
- [ ] Ensure quality-check works without zombie management
- [ ] Update tests if they relied on process tracking
- [ ] Verify quality-check package still functions correctly
- [ ] Remove any process tracking configuration

## Technical Details

- **Implementation approach**: Refactor quality-check to remove process tracking
  dependencies
- **Key considerations**:
  - Maintain core quality-check functionality
  - Remove only zombie management related code
  - Ensure tests still pass after changes
  - Keep the package focused on its primary purpose
- **Code locations/files affected**:
  - `packages/quality-check/` (entire package)
  - Any files importing from processTracker
  - Tests that relied on process tracking

## Dependencies

- [ ] Task 007 completed (processTracker file deleted)
- [ ] Task 010 completed (import references identified and removed)
- [ ] Understanding of quality-check package functionality

## Effort Estimate

- Size: S
- Hours: 1
- Parallel: false (needs to ensure no conflicts with other changes)

## Definition of Done

- [ ] All processTracker imports removed from quality-check
- [ ] Quality-check package functionality preserved
- [ ] Tests updated and passing
- [ ] No process tracking dependencies remain
- [ ] Package configuration cleaned up
- [ ] Quality-check still enforces code quality properly
- [ ] No breaking changes to quality-check API
