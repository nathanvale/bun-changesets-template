# Task: Extended Testing Period

## Description

Monitor for zombie processes over a 48-hour period across all testing scenarios
to ensure the new simplified approach prevents zombie processes reliably without
the complex management system.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Monitor normal test runs for zombie processes
- [ ] Test interrupted test runs (Ctrl+C scenarios) for zombie prevention
- [ ] Validate CI pipeline runs produce no zombies
- [ ] Test integration test runs for stability
- [ ] Verify Wallaby.js compatibility if applicable
- [ ] Document any issues found during monitoring period
- [ ] Achieve 48 hours of zombie-free operation

## Technical Details

- **Implementation approach**: Systematic monitoring over 48-hour period
- **Key considerations**:
  - Monitor during different types of test executions
  - Test both normal and abnormal termination scenarios
  - Use system tools to detect any zombie processes
  - Document all test scenarios and results
- **Code locations/files affected**: Entire test suite and CI pipeline

## Dependencies

- [ ] Task 013 completed (quality-check updated)
- [ ] All previous tasks completed successfully
- [ ] Process monitoring tools available
- [ ] Access to CI environment for testing

## Effort Estimate

- Size: L
- Hours: 48 (monitoring time, not active work)
- Parallel: false (must be comprehensive final validation)

## Definition of Done

- [ ] 48 hours of continuous monitoring completed
- [ ] Normal test execution produces no zombie processes
- [ ] Interrupted test execution (Ctrl+C) produces no zombies
- [ ] CI pipeline runs produce no zombie processes
- [ ] Integration tests run without creating zombies
- [ ] Wallaby.js compatibility confirmed (if used)
- [ ] Monitoring results documented
- [ ] Zero zombie processes detected throughout entire period
