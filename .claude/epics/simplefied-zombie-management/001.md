# Task: Complete File Inventory and Line Count Verification

## Description

Audit all zombie management files for removal by creating a complete inventory
with line counts and verification that all 8 target files exist and contain the
expected complexity.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Verify exact line counts for all 8 zombie management files
- [ ] Document import/reference mapping across the codebase
- [ ] Create backup of current working system
- [ ] Confirm total line count exceeds 1000 lines as stated in epic

## Technical Details

- **Implementation approach**: Use file analysis tools to count lines and map
  dependencies
- **Key considerations**: Ensure no files are missed that contribute to zombie
  management
- **Code locations/files affected**:
  - `vitest.force-kill.setup.ts` (expected: 330 lines)
  - `vitest.globalSetup.ts` (expected: 29 lines)
  - `vitest.globalTeardown.ts` (expected: 91 lines)
  - `tests/setup/zombie-prevention.ts` (expected: 77 lines)
  - `packages/quality-check/src/process-tracker.ts` (expected: 339 lines)
  - `scripts/emergency-cleanup.ts` (TBD lines)
  - `scripts/kill-all-zombies.sh` (TBD lines)
  - `scripts/detect-zombies.sh` (TBD lines)

## Dependencies

- [ ] No external dependencies
- [ ] All zombie management files must exist and be accessible

## Effort Estimate

- Size: S
- Hours: 2
- Parallel: true (can run in parallel with other audit tasks)

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Complete line count report generated
- [ ] All file locations verified
- [ ] Import/reference mapping documented
- [ ] Current system backed up safely
- [ ] Total complexity baseline established for >90% reduction target
