# Task: Clean Up Package.json Scripts

## Description

Remove zombie-specific npm scripts from package.json that are no longer needed
with the simplified approach.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Remove "zombies": "tsx scripts/emergency-cleanup.ts" script
- [ ] Remove "zombies:kill": "./scripts/kill-all-zombies.sh" script
- [ ] Remove "test:safe": "./scripts/test-with-cleanup.sh" script
- [ ] Remove complex "test:debug" with thread configuration
- [ ] Verify no broken script references remain
- [ ] Clean up any zombie-related script descriptions

## Technical Details

- **Implementation approach**: Edit package.json to remove zombie-related
  scripts
- **Key considerations**:
  - Preserve all non-zombie-related scripts
  - Check for any dependencies between scripts
  - Verify removed scripts aren't referenced elsewhere
- **Code locations/files affected**:
  - `package.json` (scripts section)
  - Potentially workspace package.json files

## Dependencies

- [ ] Task 007 completed (zombie management files removed)
- [ ] Scripts actually exist in package.json
- [ ] No critical dependencies on these scripts

## Effort Estimate

- Size: XS
- Hours: 0.25
- Parallel: true (can run alongside other cleanup)

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Zombie-specific scripts removed from package.json
- [ ] No broken script references in package.json
- [ ] Script descriptions cleaned up
- [ ] package.json validates correctly
- [ ] Essential non-zombie scripts preserved
- [ ] All workspace package.json files updated if needed
