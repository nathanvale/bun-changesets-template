# Task: Reference Dependency Mapping

## Description

Map all imports and references to zombie management code across the entire
codebase to ensure complete removal without breaking dependencies.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] List all files importing `processTracker` from quality-check package
- [ ] List all files referencing global setup/teardown files
- [ ] List all tests using complex cleanup patterns
- [ ] Document any indirect dependencies or references
- [ ] Create removal plan that avoids breaking changes

## Technical Details

- **Implementation approach**: Use grep/ripgrep to search for imports and
  references
- **Key considerations**:
  - Search for both direct imports and string references
  - Check for dynamic imports or require() calls
  - Look for configuration references in package.json, vitest.config.ts, etc.
- **Code locations/files affected**: Entire codebase scan required

## Dependencies

- [ ] No external dependencies
- [ ] Access to search tools (grep/ripgrep)

## Effort Estimate

- Size: XS
- Hours: 1
- Parallel: true (can run alongside file inventory)

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Complete list of files importing processTracker
- [ ] Complete list of files referencing global setup/teardown
- [ ] Complete list of tests with complex cleanup patterns
- [ ] Dependency removal plan documented
- [ ] No breaking changes identified in removal plan
