# Task: Remove Import References

## Description

Clean up all imports and references to removed zombie management code across the
codebase to ensure no broken imports or references remain.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Remove all `processTracker` imports from files
- [ ] Remove references to deleted global setup files
- [ ] Update any test files using complex cleanup patterns
- [ ] Fix any broken import statements
- [ ] Ensure no dead code references remain

## Technical Details

- **Implementation approach**: Use dependency mapping from Task 002 to
  systematically remove imports
- **Key considerations**:
  - Use the dependency mapping created in Task 002
  - Check for both named and default imports
  - Look for dynamic imports or require() calls
  - Update test files to use simple cleanup patterns
- **Code locations/files affected**: All files identified in dependency mapping

## Dependencies

- [ ] Task 002 completed (dependency mapping available)
- [ ] Task 007 completed (files actually deleted)
- [ ] Access to dependency mapping results

## Effort Estimate

- Size: XS
- Hours: 0.5
- Parallel: true (can run alongside other cleanup tasks)

## Definition of Done

- [ ] All processTracker imports removed
- [ ] All references to deleted global setup files removed
- [ ] Test files updated with simple cleanup patterns
- [ ] No broken import statements remain
- [ ] No TypeScript/ESLint errors from missing imports
- [ ] Codebase compiles and runs without import errors
