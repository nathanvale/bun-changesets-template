# Project Progress

## Current Status
- **Branch:** test-reliability-fixes
- **State:** Actively developing test reliability improvements
- **Phase:** Infrastructure optimization and noise reduction

## Recent Achievements

### Test Infrastructure Improvements
- ✅ Implemented VITEST_SILENT environment variable for noise reduction
- ✅ Enhanced memory monitoring with environment-dependent fixes
- ✅ Added targeted console filtering in test environments
- ✅ Removed conflicting --silent flags that increased verbosity
- ✅ Updated environment variables documentation

### Recent Commits (Latest First)
1. Enhanced test noise reduction with targeted filtering
2. Resolved environment-dependent test failures in memory monitoring
3. Implemented test output noise reduction with VITEST_SILENT
4. Further reduced test noise by mocking console in tests
5. Fixed verbose output issue from --silent flag
6. Updated environment variables documentation
7. Added changeset for test noise reduction feature
8. Documented environment variables and verified noise reduction
9. Fixed test infrastructure with git error suppression
10. Optimized package scripts and memory monitoring

## Outstanding Changes
- Multiple deleted .agent-os files (cache, instructions, specs, recaps)
- Deleted .claude configuration files and commands
- New error types file pending: `packages/utils/src/errors/types.ts`
- Untracked .claude files for PM and context systems

## Immediate Next Steps

### Priority 1: Complete Test Reliability
- [ ] Merge test-reliability-fixes branch
- [ ] Validate all tests pass in CI environment
- [ ] Document test noise reduction approach

### Priority 2: Context System Setup
- [ ] Establish full context documentation
- [ ] Configure PM system integration
- [ ] Clean up deleted files from git

### Priority 3: Error Handling Enhancement
- [ ] Complete error types implementation
- [ ] Add comprehensive error handling patterns
- [ ] Document error handling approach

## Blockers & Issues
- Large number of deleted files need cleanup decision
- Context system not fully initialized
- PM system configuration pending

## Technical Debt
- Test teardown timeout of 15s indicates potential cleanup issues
- Memory management scripts use hardcoded 4GB limits
- Multiple Vitest versions may cause inconsistencies

## Success Metrics
- Test execution time: <3s for focused tests
- Build time: <8s warm builds achieved
- Test noise: Significantly reduced with VITEST_SILENT
- Memory usage: Monitored but needs optimization
