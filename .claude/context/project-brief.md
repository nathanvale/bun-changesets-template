# Project Brief

## Project Identity
**Name:** bun-changesets-template (Node.js + pnpm variant)
**Type:** Monorepo Template
**Category:** Developer Tools / Project Scaffolding

## What It Does
Provides a production-ready monorepo template specifically optimized for developers with ADHD, featuring pre-configured tooling for Node.js applications with TypeScript, testing, quality checks, and automated releases.

## Why It Exists

### Problem Statement
Developers, especially those with ADHD, lose productivity due to:
- Slow feedback loops that break flow state
- Overwhelming configuration complexity
- Decision paralysis from too many options
- Context switching during long build/test cycles

### Solution
A meticulously crafted template that:
- Delivers sub-8-second builds
- Reduces configuration by 85%
- Provides opinionated, working defaults
- Maintains focus through rapid feedback

## Core Objectives

### Primary Goals
1. **Minimize Cognitive Load:** Reduce mental overhead through simplification
2. **Maximize Flow State:** Keep developers in the zone with fast feedback
3. **Ensure Quality:** Automated checks without manual intervention
4. **Accelerate Start:** From clone to coding in under 5 minutes

### Success Criteria
- ✅ Build times under 8 seconds
- ✅ Test execution under 3 seconds
- ✅ Less than 50 lines of config
- ✅ Under 20 commands to learn
- ✅ Zero-decision initial setup

## Scope Definition

### In Scope
- Monorepo structure and tooling
- TypeScript configuration
- Testing infrastructure (Vitest)
- Code quality automation (ESLint, Prettier)
- Build system (Turborepo, tsup)
- Release management (Changesets)
- Git hooks and CI/CD basics
- Example packages demonstrating patterns

### Out of Scope
- Application-specific logic
- Backend frameworks
- Database configurations
- Deployment pipelines
- Authentication systems
- UI component libraries (planned for future)

## Key Differentiators

### ADHD Optimization
- **Quiet Modes:** Reduce visual noise
- **Progressive Testing:** Quick → Thorough
- **Minimal Commands:** 4-command pattern per package
- **Fast Everything:** Nothing over 8 seconds

### Technical Excellence
- Modern toolchain (2025 standards)
- Performance-first configuration
- Memory-conscious settings
- Professional-grade setup

## Target Outcomes

### For Individual Developers
- Start projects faster
- Maintain focus longer
- Ship with confidence
- Learn best practices

### For Teams
- Consistent project structure
- Reduced onboarding time
- Shared quality standards
- Collaborative efficiency

### For the Ecosystem
- Promote ADHD-friendly development
- Share optimized configurations
- Demonstrate best practices
- Enable rapid prototyping

## Stakeholders

### Direct Users
- Individual developers (primary)
- Development teams
- Open source projects
- Startups and enterprises

### Indirect Beneficiaries
- End users of applications built with template
- Companies saving development time
- Open source community

## Constraints

### Technical Requirements
- Must support Node.js 20+ LTS
- Must use pnpm for package management
- Must maintain <8s build times
- Must provide TypeScript support

### Design Constraints
- Keep configuration minimal
- Maintain opinioned defaults
- Prioritize speed over flexibility
- Focus on JavaScript/TypeScript ecosystem

## Risk Mitigation

### Performance Degradation
- **Risk:** Build times increase over time
- **Mitigation:** Regular performance testing, caching optimization

### Complexity Creep
- **Risk:** Features add configuration complexity
- **Mitigation:** Strict limits on config lines, regular audits

### Dependency Management
- **Risk:** Outdated or vulnerable dependencies
- **Mitigation:** Automated updates, security scanning

## Success Metrics

### Quantitative
- GitHub stars and forks
- npm downloads (if published)
- Build/test performance benchmarks
- Time-to-first-commit measurements

### Qualitative
- Developer satisfaction feedback
- ADHD developer testimonials
- Community contributions
- Template adoption stories

## Project Philosophy

> "Cognitive load is a finite resource that must be carefully managed."

Every decision in this template is made to:
1. Reduce unnecessary thinking
2. Accelerate feedback loops
3. Maintain development flow
4. Deliver professional results

The template succeeds when developers forget about the infrastructure and focus entirely on building their application.
