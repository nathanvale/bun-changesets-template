# Product Context

## Product Vision
A monorepo template that eliminates cognitive overhead for ADHD developers by providing lightning-fast feedback loops, minimal configuration, and an opinionated structure that prevents decision paralysis.

## Target Users

### Primary Persona: ADHD Developer
**Characteristics:**
- Easily distracted by slow build times
- Overwhelmed by configuration complexity
- Needs immediate feedback to maintain flow
- Benefits from opinionated defaults

**Pain Points:**
- Context switching from slow builds/tests
- Analysis paralysis from too many options
- Lost productivity from complex setups
- Difficulty maintaining focus during long operations

**Success Criteria:**
- Can stay in flow state for extended periods
- Minimal cognitive load for routine tasks
- Fast enough feedback to prevent distraction
- Clear, simple command structure

### Secondary Persona: Team Lead
**Characteristics:**
- Manages diverse team with varying experience
- Needs consistent project structure
- Values developer productivity
- Focuses on maintainability

**Pain Points:**
- Inconsistent project setups across teams
- Time wasted on configuration
- Onboarding complexity for new developers
- Build system performance issues

## Core Features

### 1. Lightning-Fast Performance
**What:** Sub-8-second builds, sub-3-second tests
**Why:** Prevents context switching and maintains flow state
**How:** Turborepo caching, optimized configs, parallel execution

### 2. Minimal Configuration
**What:** 85% reduction in config lines (315 → 48)
**Why:** Reduces cognitive load and setup time
**How:** Sensible defaults, inherited configs, convention over configuration

### 3. ADHD-Optimized DX
**What:** Reduced command set, quiet output modes, progressive testing
**Why:** Prevents overwhelm and distraction
**How:** Curated scripts, silent modes, tiered test execution

### 4. Monorepo Structure
**What:** Pre-configured workspace with example packages
**Why:** Provides clear organization without decision paralysis
**How:** pnpm workspaces, Turborepo orchestration, shared utilities

### 5. Quality Automation
**What:** Pre-commit hooks, CI/CD pipelines, automated releases
**Why:** Maintains quality without manual overhead
**How:** Husky, GitHub Actions, Changesets
