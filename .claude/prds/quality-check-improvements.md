# PRD: quality-check-improvements

## Executive Summary

This PRD outlines comprehensive improvements to the quality-check package, a
critical tool used by external consumers and CI/CD systems for automated code
quality enforcement. The improvements address immediate correctness issues (P0),
tooling consistency problems (P1), and strategic enhancements that will improve
reliability, performance, and developer experience. The package currently has
strong architecture and 72% test coverage but requires targeted fixes to resolve
compilation errors and tooling inconsistencies that impact external users.

## Problem Statement

The quality-check package, while architecturally sound with its "fix-first"
pipeline and Autopilot classification system, currently faces several issues
that impact external consumers and CI systems:

### Critical Issues (P0)

- **Compilation failure**: TypeScript error in test-environment.ts prevents
  successful builds and masks potential regressions
- **Quality gate failures**: Build and typecheck gates are currently failing,
  blocking CI/CD pipelines
- **Test files cleanup needed**: `packages/quality-check/test-files` directory
  purpose unclear, potentially removable
- **Log directory structure**: Logs in `.quality-check/logs` with package name
  duplication, not gitignored

### Important Issues (P1)

- **Tooling confusion**: Inconsistent package manager references (npm/pnpm/bun)
  causing friction for external consumers
- **File matching inconsistencies**: Potential mismatches between custom
  matchers and ESLint/Prettier's native resolution
- **Incomplete fix safety controls**: ESLint fixes applied too broadly in
  automated modes without constraint options
- **Git operation edge cases**: Shell expansion vulnerabilities and missing path
  normalization

### Why Now?

- External consumers depend on this package for their CI/CD quality gates
- Current compilation errors block adoption and updates
- Tooling inconsistencies create unnecessary support burden
- Performance improvements would reduce CI build times and costs

## User Stories

### Primary Personas

#### 1. External Package Consumer

**As an** external developer consuming the quality-check package **I want** the
package to build and run without errors **So that** I can integrate it into my
project's quality gates

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- Package installs cleanly with documented package manager
- All TypeScript files compile without errors
- Clear documentation on which package manager to use
- Consistent command examples throughout documentation

#### 2. CI/CD System Administrator

**As a** CI/CD system administrator **I want** predictable and safe automated
fixes **So that** I can run quality checks in unattended pipelines

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- Ability to constrain fix types in automated mode
- Proper timeout and cancellation handling
- Clear error messages for debugging failures
- Consistent file matching behavior

#### 3. DevOps Engineer

**As a** DevOps engineer **I want** robust git operations and proper resource
management **So that** I can run quality checks in containerized environments

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- Safe git operations without shell expansion risks
- Proper path normalization for nested packages
- Resource cleanup on timeout/cancellation
- Log rotation for long-running processes
