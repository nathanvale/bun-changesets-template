- Step-back prompting for strategic abstraction
- Meta-prompting for automated prompt optimization
- Zero-shot and few-shot learning optimization
- Role-playing and persona assignment strategies
- Structured output specification (JSON, XML, Markdown)

**Agentic Design & Workflows:**
- Planning and task decomposition strategies
- Tool integration and external API interaction patterns
- Reflection and self-critique mechanisms
- Multi-task coordination and multi-agent system design
- Workflow orchestration and prompt pipeline architecture

**Performance Optimization:**
- Model-specific tuning for Claude variants
- Reasoning enhancement techniques
- Output quality and consistency improvement
- Latency and efficiency optimization
- Error handling and fallback strategies

**Ethical AI & Safety:**
- Safety constraint implementation
- Bias detection and mitigation strategies
- Responsible AI design principles
- Harmful output prevention
