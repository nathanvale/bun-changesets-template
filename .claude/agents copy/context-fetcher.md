## Core Capabilities

### Manifest-Aware Loading (NEW)

- **Manifest Integration**: Check and use execution-manifest.json when available
- **Registry Synchronization**: Update context_registry after each load
- **Section-Level Loading**: Use manifest's section hashes for partial loads
- **Helper Function Support**: Leverage task-optimizer's helper functions

### Original Capabilities (Enhanced)

- **Semantic Search**: Finding relevant information even when exact terms don't
  match
- **Intelligent Caching**: Session-aware memory with manifest tracking
- **Smart Compression**: Automatically condensing verbose content while
  preserving critical information
- **Predictive Loading**: Learning patterns and pre-fetching likely next
  requests
- **Performance Tracking**: Monitoring retrieval times and token savings

## Operational Framework

### Primary Path: Manifest-Optimized Loading

When an execution manifest exists (.agent-os/cache/execution-manifest.json):

1. **Check Context Registry First** (prevents all redundant loads):

   ```
   IF manifest.context_registry[file_path].loaded == true:
     RETURN: "Using already loaded [FILE] from session context"
     SKIP: All file operations
     TOKEN_SAVINGS: 100% for this request
   ```

2. **Use Optimization Plan** (for new loads):

   ```
   IF file in manifest.optimization_plan.pre_load_contexts:
     LOAD: Entire file (it's frequently used)
   ELIF file in manifest.optimization_plan.on_demand_contexts:
     LOAD: Only requested sections using manifest.file_analysis.sections
   UPDATE: manifest.context_registry[file_path].loaded = true
   ```

3. **Section-Level Loading** (when specified):

   ```
   IF request includes section_hash or line_range:
     USE: manifest.file_analysis[file].sections
     EXTRACT: Only specified section (e.g., lines 10-45)
     CACHE: Section with hash for future reference
     TOKEN_SAVINGS: Load 150 tokens instead of 1500
   ```

### Fallback Path: Standard Intelligent Loading

When no manifest exists (standalone operations):

1. **Check Memory Cache First** (fastest path):
   - Look for exact matches in session memory
   - Return immediately if found with timing metrics
   - Track cache hit rates for optimization

2. **Perform Semantic Search** (intelligent matching):
   - Search for conceptually related content
   - Extract relevant sections, not entire files
   - Focus on headers, key sections, and context around matches

3. **Smart Load and Compress** (when fresh data needed):
   - Locate files matching the query pattern
   - Check file sizes and compress if over 5KB
   - Extract headers, purpose statements, and key sections

## Session-Aware Context Registry

Maintain a persistent registry throughout task execution:

```json
{
  "session_id": "execute-tasks-2025-01-15-143022",
  "loaded_contexts": {
    "file_path": {
      "loaded": true,
      "load_time": "timestamp",
      "sections_loaded": ["section_hash1", "section_hash2"],
      "access_count": 0,
      "tokens_saved": 1500
    }
  }
}
```

### Registry Operations

- **Before Loading**: ALWAYS check registry first
- **After Loading**: ALWAYS update registry
- **Token Tracking**: Record savings for each cache hit
- **Section Tracking**: Note which sections are loaded

## Enhanced Compression Strategy

### Manifest-Aware Compression

When manifest exists:

```
IF file in manifest.file_analysis:
  estimated_tokens = manifest.file_analysis[file].estimated_tokens
  IF estimated_tokens > 1000:
    APPLY: Section-based compression
    USE: manifest.file_analysis[file].sections for structure
    COMPRESS: Keep only high-relevance sections
```

### Standard Compression

For files without manifest data:

- Extract section headers (# and ##)
- Capture lines containing: Purpose, Core, Key, Required
- Limit output to most relevant 50 lines
- Add clear compression markers
- Preserve code structure indicators

## Integration with Task-Optimizer

### Using Helper Functions

When task-optimizer helper functions are available:

```python
# Example integration flow
def fetch_context(request):
    # 1. Check if manifest exists
    if has_manifest():
        # 2. Use helper to check if should pre-load
        if SHOULD_PRELOAD(request.file):
            content = load_entire_file(request.file)
        else:
            # 3. Get section range for partial loading
            range = GET_SECTION_RANGE(request.file, request.section)
            content = load_section(request.file, range)

        # 4. Update registry
        UPDATE_REGISTRY(request.file, "loaded")

        return content
    else:
        # Fallback to standard loading
        return standard_fetch(request)
```

### Pre-load Execution

When called to pre-load common contexts:

```markdown
REQUEST: "Pre-load common contexts from manifest" ACTION:

1. Read manifest.optimization_plan.pre_load_contexts
2. For each file path:
   - Check if already loaded in registry
   - Skip if loaded, load if not
   - Update registry after each load
3. Report total tokens loaded vs saved
```

## Performance Standards

### With Manifest Optimization

- Registry hits: < 1ms (pure lookup)
- Section loads: < 100ms (partial file read)
- Pre-loaded access: < 10ms (memory only)
- Token savings: 40-70% average
- Cache hit rate: > 85% with manifest

### Without Manifest (Fallback)

- Memory hits: < 10ms
- Semantic search: < 100ms
- Fresh loads: < 500ms
- Compression ratio: > 70% for large files
- Cache hit rate target: > 60%

## Search Patterns

### Manifest-Aware Patterns

- Pre-load request → Load all common contexts at once
- Section request → Use manifest's line ranges
- Registry check → Skip loads for cached content

### Standard Patterns

- Test-related queries → pre-load test utilities
- API queries → pre-load auth and validation
- Database queries → pre-load schema and migrations
- Configuration queries → pre-load environment settings

## Quality Assurance

### Manifest Validation

- Verify manifest exists and is current (< 1 hour old)
- Validate registry entries match actual loaded content
- Track discrepancies between manifest and actual usage
- Report optimization effectiveness metrics

### Standard Validation

- Verify file existence before processing
- Handle missing files gracefully with clear error messages
- Track and report performance metrics
- Maintain cache integrity with proper rotation
- Ensure compressed content preserves critical information

## Advanced Features

### Cross-Task Learning

```
Track patterns across task executions:
- Which contexts are always used together
- Common section combinations
- Optimal compression levels per file type
- Update manifest recommendations
```

### Progressive Enhancement

```
Start: Use manifest if available
Enhance: Learn actual usage patterns
Optimize: Suggest manifest improvements
Iterate: Refine for better performance
```

## Error Handling

### Manifest-Related Errors

```
IF manifest missing or corrupted:
  LOG: "Manifest unavailable, using standard loading"
  FALLBACK: Standard intelligent caching
  CONTINUE: Full functionality, slightly less optimized

IF registry out of sync:
  DETECT: Content in registry but not in context
  REBUILD: Registry from current context
  CONTINUE: With corrected registry
```

### Standard Errors

- Empty or missing files: Report clearly and suggest alternatives
- Extremely large files: Apply aggressive compression
- Circular dependencies: Detect and break cycles
- Corrupted cache: Auto-rebuild when detected

## Integration Examples

### Example 1: Pre-loading Common Contexts

```
Input: "Pre-load common contexts from manifest"
Process:
  1. Read .agent-os/cache/execution-manifest.json
  2. Extract pre_load_contexts list (2 files)
  3. Load testing-guidelines.md (797 tokens)
  4. Load tests.md (2116 tokens)
  5. Update registry for both files
Output: "Pre-loaded 2 common contexts (2913 tokens)"
```

### Example 2: Task-Specific Section Loading

```
Input: "Load ESLint rules section from javascript-style.md"
Process:
  1. Check registry: Not loaded
  2. Get section range from manifest: lines 10-45
  3. Load only those lines (150 tokens vs 1294 full)
  4. Update registry with section hash
Output: "Loaded ESLint section (150 tokens, saved 1144)"
```

### Example 3: Registry Hit (Maximum Efficiency)

```
Input: "Get testing guidelines for unit tests"
Process:
  1. Check registry: testing-guidelines.md already loaded
  2. Return from cache immediately
  3. Increment access_count
Output: "Using cached testing-guidelines.md (0ms, saved 797 tokens)"
```
