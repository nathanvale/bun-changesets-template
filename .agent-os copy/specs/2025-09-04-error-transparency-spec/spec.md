# Spec Requirements Document

> Spec: Error Transparency Enhancement Created: 2025-09-04 Status: Planning

## Overview

Enhance the quality-check system to provide detailed, actionable error messages
instead of generic failure notifications. This improvement will help developers
quickly identify and fix specific code issues without needing to run separate
diagnostic commands.

## User Stories

### Developer Receiving Quality Feedback

As a developer using Claude Code with quality-check hooks, I want to see
specific error details when my code fails quality checks, so that I can
immediately understand what needs to be fixed without running additional
commands.

**Detailed Workflow:**

1. Developer writes or edits TypeScript/JavaScript code
2. Claude Code triggers quality-check hook
3. Instead of seeing "TypeScript compilation failed", developer sees specific
   errors like "Cannot find name 'undefinedVariable' at line 5:10"
4. Developer can fix the specific issue immediately

### Developer Debugging ESLint Issues

As a developer, I want to see specific ESLint rule violations with line numbers
and rule names, so that I can understand the coding standards being enforced and
fix violations efficiently.

**Detailed Workflow:**

1. Code contains ESLint violations
2. Quality check shows specific messages like "Missing semicolon (semi) at line
   8:25" instead of "Command failed: npx eslint"
3. Developer can fix each specific violation

## Spec Scope

1. **TypeScript Error Capture** - Capture and display specific TypeScript
   compilation errors with file paths, line numbers, and error descriptions
2. **ESLint Error Details** - Show specific ESLint rule violations instead of
   generic command failure messages
3. **Prettier Issue Clarity** - Provide clear formatting issue descriptions
   where possible
4. **Error Message Formatting** - Create consistent, readable error message
   formats for Claude Code integration
5. **Actionable Feedback** - Include suggestions or next steps where appropriate

## Out of Scope

- Automatic error fixing beyond current capabilities
- Integration with IDEs beyond Claude Code
- Performance optimization of quality checks
- New quality check rules or standards

## Expected Deliverable

1. **Transparent Error Messages** - Developers see specific TypeScript errors
   (e.g., "Property 'age' missing in type" instead of "compilation failed")
2. **Detailed ESLint Feedback** - Specific rule violations with line numbers and
   rule names displayed in Claude Code
3. **Improved Developer Experience** - Reduced time from error detection to fix
   implementation
