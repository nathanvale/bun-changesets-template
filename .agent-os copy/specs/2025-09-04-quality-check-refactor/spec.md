> Spec: Quality Check Package Refactor Created: 2025-09-04 Status: Planning

## Overview

Refactor the quality-check package from ~1000 lines to ~440 lines using a facade
pattern that provides flexibility without complexity. This enables multiple
consumption patterns (CLI, Hook, Pre-commit, API) while following YAGNI
principles to ship working software in 1 week.

## User Stories

### Developer Using Claude Code

As a developer using Claude Code, I want the quality-check to silently fix 80%+
of issues, so that I maintain flow state without interruptions.

When Claude generates code with linting errors or formatting issues, the hook
automatically fixes what's safe (formatting, simple ESLint rules) and only
interrupts for critical issues that need human decision. The system learns from
patterns over time to improve its automation rate.

### Team Lead Managing Standards

As a team lead, I want consistent code quality enforcement across all entry
points (CLI, pre-commit, API), so that code quality is maintained regardless of
how developers interact with the system.

Whether developers run quality checks through the command line, git hooks, or
programmatically, they get the same enforcement and fixes applied. The facade
pattern ensures all consumers get identical behavior from the shared core logic.

## Spec Scope

1. **Package Refactor** - Restructure existing quality-check package into core +
   facades architecture
2. **Facade Implementation** - Create thin facades (~50 lines each) for CLI,
   Hook, Pre-commit, and API
3. **Autopilot Adapter** - Add intelligent classification for 80%+ silent fixing
4. **Claude Hook Integration** - Deploy thin wrapper to ~/.claude/hooks/ for
   Claude Code
5. **Cleanup & Simplification** - Delete unnecessary enforcement files and
   complex patterns

## Out of Scope

- Complex routing patterns or dependency injection
- Learning system implementation (future phase)
- Dashboard or UI components
- Configuration file system (use simple JSON for now)
- Worker pools or parallel processing

## Expected Deliverable

1. Refactored quality-check package with ~440 total lines that works across all
   consumption patterns
2. Silent fixing of 80%+ of common issues through Claude hook with <2s
   processing time
3. All tests passing and existing functionality preserved through facade pattern
